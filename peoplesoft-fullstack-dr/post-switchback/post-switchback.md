  **PeopleSoft application is accessible from the primary region (Ashburn)**

## Task 3: Verify DNS domain record and PeopleSoft Process Instances

1. Run nslookup command to verify that DNS domain record is resolving to public IP of Phoenix Load Balancer.

2. Login to PeopleSoft application and go to Process Monitor to check and verify that Processes which were ran in Phoenix region are still present and accessible after switching to Ashburn region.

We have now achieved the complete automation of switching over (rollback) a PeopleSoft application (Full Stack) from Phoenix region to Ashburn region with a single click of a button.
