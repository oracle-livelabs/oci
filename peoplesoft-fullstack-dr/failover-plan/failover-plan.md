# Create and Customize the DR Failover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will create a DR Failover plan and customize the plan with the additional steps. Ashburn is the primary region and Phoenix is the standby region. FSDR provides two types of plan

- Switchover (Maintenance/Planned Disaster Recovery)
- Failover   (Actual Disaster Recovery/Unplanned)

Failover is the process of transferring mission-critical workloads from the primary production center and recovering the system at an off-site location (DR region). The main goal of failover is to mitigate the negative impact of a disaster or service disruption on business services and customers. Hence all of the tasks as part of this failover lab will be executed in the DR region which is Phoenix.

This lab will focus on how to create a Failover plan and customize the plan as per PeopleSoft application requirements. 

**DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Phoenix)**. It is because, in the case of the worst-case scenario, the entire primary region outside the FSDR will not be accessible from the primary region.

Estimated Time: 60 Minutes

### Objectives

- Create a Failover plan
- Customize the Failover plan - Add DNS Record Update Script
- Customize the Failover plan - Add PeopleSoft Application boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Failover plan - Add Elastic Search Service boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Failover plan - Add Kibana Service boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Failover plan - Enable files synchronization (rsync) jobs in Phoenix 
- Customize the Failover plan - DR Plan Re-Ordering

## Task 1: Create a Failover plan

1. Login into OCI Console. Select region as **Phoenix**.

  ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region1.png)

2. Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Phoenix**

  ![phoenix region drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgpage.png)

3. You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Phoenix region. **DR Plans always be created in the Standby DRPG (Phoenix region)**

  ![drpg home](./images/phoenix-drpg.png)

4. Select the **FSCM92-FSDR-Group-Phoenix** DRPG and navigate to Plans under the resources section. Click on Create Plan.

  ![drpg dr plan](./images/phoenix-drplan.png)

  Provide a name for the Failover Plan.

  Select Plan type as **Failover (planned)**.

  ![drpg create plan](./images/phoenix-create-drplan.png)

  The plan will start creating.

  ![drpg creating plan](./images/phoenix-drplan-creating.png)

  Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within few minutes, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

  ![drpg plan created](./images/phoenix-drplan-created.png)

  Select the **FSCM92\_FSDR\_Failover\_From\_Ashburn\_To\_Phoenix** plan, and you should be able to see the built-in plan groups.

  ![drpg plan details](./images/phoenix-drplan-details.png)

  Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, FSDR created these built-in plans.

- **Built-in Prechecks** - These are the prechecks for the DB Failover.
- **Failover Databases (Standby)** - Database Failover.
