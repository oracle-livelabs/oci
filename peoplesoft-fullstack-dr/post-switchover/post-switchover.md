2. Open a tab in your browser and access the PeopleSoft Application. You should be able to see that the application is working as expected from the Phoenix region.

  **PeopleSoft application is accessible from the new primary region (Phoenix)**

## Task 3: Verify DNS domain record and PeopleSoft Process Instances

1. Run nslookup command to verify that DNS domain record is resolving to public IP of Phoenix Load Balancer.

2. Login to PeopleSoft application and go to Process Monitor to check and verify that Processes which were ran in Ashburn region are still present and accessible after switching to Phoenix region.

We have now achieved the complete automation of switching over a PeopleSoft application (Full Stack) from Ashburn region to Phoenix region with a single click of a button.
