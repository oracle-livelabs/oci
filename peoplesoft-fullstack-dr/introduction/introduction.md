# **Protect PeopleSoft Application using Oracle Full Stack Disaster Recovery**

## About the Workshop

In this workshop, we will see how easily Full Stack Disaster Recovery will help to orchestrate DR Switchover and Failover operations for a PeopleSoft Application deployed in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) across two OCI regions.

### **Estimated Workshop Time**

Approximately 6 hrs

### Workshop Objectives

- Create DR Protection groups (DRPG) in Ashburn (Primary) and Phoenix (Standby) regions
- Associate Ashburn DRPG as Primary and Phoenix DRPG as Standby
- Add members to Ashburn DRPG - Application Virtual machines and Primary Oracle Base DB Services database

- Create and Customize DR Switchover Plan in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Switchover Pre-checks in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Switchover Plan in Phoenix (Standby) DRPG
- Verify the PeopleSoft application accessibility from Phoenix (New Primary) region
- Create and Customize DR Switchover (Rollback) Plan in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Switchover (Rollback) Pre-checks in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Switchover (Rollback) Plan in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Verify the PeopleSoft application accessibility from Ashburn (New Primary) region
- Create and Customize DR Failover Plan in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Failover Pre-checks in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Execute DR Failover Plan in Ashburn (Standby) DRPG
- Verify the PeopleSoft application accessibility from Phoenix (New Primary) region

## Overview of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery

Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service is a fully managed OCI disaster recovery orchestration and management service that provides comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities for all layers of an application stack, including infrastructure, middleware, database, and application across  **OCI regions**.

- Full Stack Disaster Recovery assures comprehensive business continuity from a variety of data center outages. Using Disaster Recovery Service for disaster recovery ensures that organizations are minimally impacted if there is a region-wide outage or Availability Domain outage.

- Full Stack Disaster Recovery provides fully automated, end-to-end disaster recovery for the entire Oracle stack, including the infrastructure, databases, engineered systems, virtual infrastructure, storage, and full-stack applications in OCI. It integrates with underlying replication mechanisms that synchronize primary and standby environments and protects mission-critical data.

- Full Stack Disaster Recovery is flexible and integrates with various Oracle platforms and non-Oracle applications and infrastructure. It generates, runs, and monitors disaster recovery plans for services and applications deployed in your tenancy. Disaster recovery operations are at the service level, so there is no impact on running other services in your tenancy. You can customize the disaster recovery plans generated by Full Stack Disaster Recovery based on your specific needs.

Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service currently supports disaster recovery for the following OCI resource types:

- Compute Instances
- Boot and Block Volumes (Volume Groups)
- Oracle Exadata Database Service
- Oracle Enterprise Database Service
- Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Exadata Infrastructure

Below are some of the critical functionalities of Full Stack Disaster Recovery Service

- Create and automate DR run books and make them more flexible.
- Manage DR operations (Switchover and Failover) using a single pane of glass.
- Provide comprehensive logs with error management and recovery.
- Perform pre-checks before the DR execution plan.
- Provide a framework to customize DR operations.

## Benefits of OCI Full Stack Disaster Recovery

Full Stack Disaster Recovery provides multiple benefits in the area of business continuity.

- Provides comprehensive disaster protection for the entire Application( Oracle/Non-Oracle) stack, including databases, Compute Instances, attached block volumes and applications across different OCI regions.
- Minimizes Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).
- Automates disaster recovery operations.
- Eliminates the need for domain specialists and dedicated administrators for disaster recovery.
- Provides highly flexible and customized disaster recovery plans. You can integrate your custom automation into the DR workflow.
- Provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring disaster recovery readiness and launching DR workflows.
- Executes scalable and reliable complete stack switchover and failover operations with a button.
- Operates at the service level instead of requiring the customer to manually failover VMs, databases, middleware, applications, storage, and load balancers.
