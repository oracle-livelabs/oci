# Create and Customize the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will create a DR Switchover plan and customize the plan with the additional steps. Ashburn is the primary region and Phoenix is the standby region. FSDR provides two types of plan

- Switchover (Maintenance/Planned Disaster Recovery)
- Failover   (Actual Disaster Recovery/Unplanned)

This lab will focus on how to create a Switchover plan and customize the plan as per the PeopleSoft application requirements. 

**DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Phoenix)**. It is because, in the case of the worst-case scenario, the entire primary region outside the FSDR will not be accessible from the primary region.

Estimated Time: 180 Minutes

### Objectives

- Enable Run Commands on all the Compute Instances
- Create a Switchover plan
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add PeopleSoft Application Shutdown group in Ashburn
- Customize the Switchover plan - Disable files synchronization (rsync) jobs in Ashburn
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add DNS Record Update Script
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add PeopleSoft Application boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add Elastic Search Service boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add Kibana Service boot up group in Phoenix
- Customize the Switchover plan - Enable files synchronization (rsync) jobs in Phoenix 
- Customize the Switchover plan - DR Plan Re-Ordering

### Prerequisites

- Install oci cli packages in the compute instance which will run the DNS record update script. Refer to [OCI CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)
- OCI user API Key added in OCI tenancy and place the configuration file in the compute instance which will be used to run the DNS record update script. Refer to [Add an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm)

## Task 1: Enable Run Commands on an Instance

Run command feature will help in executing custom start and shutdown scripts as part of the FSDR.

Please refer below link to know more about on how to enable Run Commands in Compute Instance.

[Running Commands on an Instance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/runningcommands.htm)

1. Create a dynamic group that includes the instances that you want to allow commands to run on. For example, a rule inside the dynamic group can state:

     ````
      <copy>any { instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.<unique_ID_1>', 'ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.<unique_ID_2>' }</copy>

     ````
  We will create a new dynamic group and add PeopleSoft Application Server Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Process Scheduler (Linux) Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Process Scheduler (Windows) Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Web Server and Elastic Search & Kibana services Compute Instance.

  Login to OCI Console and select *Ashburn* or *Phoenix* region as Dynamic Group will be created at tenancy level.

  Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Identity & Security** -> **Dynamic Group**.

    ![ashburn region dynamic group](./images/ashburn-dynamic-group-home.png)

2. Click on Create Dynamic Group.

   Provide a name for the Dynamic Group.

   Provide a description for the Dynamic Group.

   Click on Rule Builder.

    ![ashburn region dynamic group create](./images/ashburn-dynamic-group-create.png)

    Change Include instances that match: to **Any of the following**.

    Add one by one OCID's of both *Ashburn* and *Phoenix* regions hosted PeopleSoft Application Server Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Process Scheduler (Linux) Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Process Scheduler (Windows) Compute Instance, PeopleSoft Web Server and Elastic Search & Kibana services Compute Instance.

    ![ashburn region dynamic group rule](./images/ashburn-dynamic-group-rule.png)

    Click on Add Rule.

    Click on Create.

    ![ashburn region dynamic group rule](./images/ashburn-dynamic-group-created.png)

    You will now be able to see all the PeopleSoft Compute Instances of both *Ashburn* and *Phoenix* regions are added in the Dynamic Group.

3. Running Commands with Administrator Privileges

  If a command requires administrator permissions, you must grant administrator permissions to the Compute Instance Run Command plugin to be able to run the command. The plugin runs as the ocarun user.

  To grant sudo permissions on Linux instances, please run below commands in all of the PeopleSoft Application, Web, Process Scheduler and Elastic Search & Kibana servers of Linux.

    - On the instance, create a sudoers configuration file for the Compute Instance Run Command plugin:

     ````
      <copy>vi ./101-oracle-cloud-agent-run-command</copy>

     ````

    - Allow the ocarun user to run all commands as sudo by adding the following line to the configuration file:

     ````
      <copy>ocarun ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL</copy>

     ````

    - Validate that the syntax in the configuration file is correct:

     ````
      <copy>visudo -cf ./101-oracle-cloud-agent-run-command</copy>

     ````

    If the syntax is correct, the follow message is returned:


      **./101-oracle-cloud-agent-run-command: parsed OK**

    - Add the configuration file to /etc/sudoers.d:

     ````
      <copy>sudo cp ./101-oracle-cloud-agent-run-command /etc/sudoers.d/</copy>

     ````

    **To grant administrator permissions on Windows instances**

    - On all of the Windows instances, run the following command in PowerShell:

     ````
      <copy>Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "NT SERVICE\OCARUN" | Restart-Service -Name OCARUN -Force</copy>

     ````

## Task 2: Create a Switchover plan

1. Login into OCI Console. Select region as **Phoenix**.

  ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region1.png)

2. Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Phoenix**

  Select Plan type as **Switchover (planned)**.

  ![drpg create plan](./images/phoenix-create-drplan.png)

  The plan will start creating.

  ![drpg creating plan](./images/phoenix-drplan-creating.png)

  Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within few minutes, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

  ![drpg plan created](./images/phoenix-drplan-created.png)

  Select the **FSCM92\_FSDR\_Switchover\_From\_Ashburn\_To\_Phoenix** plan, and you should be able to see the built-in plan groups.

  ![drpg plan details](./images/phoenix-drplan-details.png)

  Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, FSDR created these built-in plans.

- **Built-in Prechecks** - These are the prechecks for the DB switchover.
- **Switchover Databases (Standby)** - Database switchover.
