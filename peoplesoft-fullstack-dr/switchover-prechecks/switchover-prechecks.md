# Perform pre-checks for the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will execute **Run Prechecks** for the **FSCM92\_FSDR\_Switchover\_From\_Ashburn\_To\_Phoenix** switchover plan, which we have created in lab 4.

Execute **Run Prechecks**  will perform only the *pre-checks* and not the actual execution. Having the pre-checks completed successfully is essential as a pre-requisite for running the actual switchover plan.

Estimated Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives

- Perform Run prechecks for the FSCM92\_FSDR\_Switchover\_From\_Ashburn\_To\_Phoenix plan
- Monitor the executed prechecks plan
- Verify the executed prechecks plan
