# Create and Customize the DR Switchover Plan (Rollback) from Phoenix to Ashburn region

## Introduction

In our previous lab, we have switched over PeopleSoft application from *Ashburn* to *Phoenix* region.

In this lab, we will create a DR Switchover (Rollback) plan (from *Phoenix* to *Ashburn*) and customize the plan with the additional steps. *Phoenix* is the primary region and *Ashburn* is the standby region. 

This lab will focus on how to create a Switchover (Rollback) plan and customize the plan as per the PeopleSoft application requirements. 

**DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Ashburn)**. 

Estimated Time: 180 Minutes

### Objectives

- Create a Switchover plan
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add PeopleSoft Application Shutdown group in Phoenix
- Customize the Switchover plan - Disable files synchronization (rsync) jobs in Phoenix
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add DNS Record Update Script
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add PeopleSoft Application Server boot up group in Ashburn
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add Elastic Search Service boot up group in Ashburn
- Customize the Switchover plan - Add Kibana Service boot up group in Ashburn
- Customize the Switchover plan - Enable files synchronization (rsync) jobs in Ashburn 
- Customize the Switchover plan - DR Plan Re-Ordering

## Task 1: Create a Switchover plan

1. Login into OCI Console. Select region as **Ashburn**.

  ![ashburn region](./images/ashburn-region.png)

2. Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Ashburn**

  ![ashburn region drpg](./images/ashburn-drpgpage.png)

3. You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Ashburn region. **DR Plans always be created in the Standby DRPG (Ashburn region)**. You can notice that Role of this DRPG is *Standby*.

  ![drpg home](./images/ashburn-drpg.png)

4. Select the **FSCM92-FSDR-Group-Ashburn** DRPG and navigate to Plans under the resources section. Click on Create Plan.

  ![drpg dr plan](./images/ashburn-drplan.png)

  Provide a name for the Switchover Plan.

  Select Plan type as **Switchover (planned)**.

  ![drpg create plan](./images/ashburn-create-drplan.png)

  The plan will start creating.

  ![drpg creating plan](./images/ashburn-drplan-creating.png)

  Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within few minutes, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

  ![drpg plan created](./images/ashburn-drplan-created.png)

  Select the **FSCM92-FSDR-Switchover-From-Phoenix-To-Ashburn** plan, and you should be able to see the built-in plan groups.

  ![drpg plan details](./images/ashburn-drplan-details.png)

  Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, FSDR created these built-in plans.

- **Built-in Prechecks** - These are the prechecks for the DB switchover.
- **Switchover Databases (Standby)** - Database switchover.
