# Get delighted with your first Unique Security Experience

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to automate the journey to security by using the provided key components that will make you have that Unique Security Experience.

Estimated time: 45 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:

- Download and run security and compliance assessment scripts
- Store assessment results in the Object Storage buckets
- Post results in Autonomous Database via REST calls
- Check those results in Security Dashboard UI

Please see picture below with the components and actions involved in this lab:

   ![](./images/second-lab-diagram.png "Diagram lab components")


### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed previous lab.

## Task 1: Download and run security assessment script

1.	Download the security assessment script in following link:
    Now you can run that security assessment script in the Oracle Cloud Shell. In order to do that, open the Oracle Cloud Shell by clicking in the Cloud Shell icon in the Console header:

    ![](images/cloud-shell-icon.png "Open Cloud Shell")

2.  Upload the script in the Cloud Shell terminal by doing drag and drop. You will see a similar message:

    ![](images/script-to-cloud-shell.png "Drag and drop into Cloud Shell")

3. Run the script in Cloud Shell with the following command:

    ```
    python3 security_assessment.py -dt --output-to-bucket security_assessment
    ```
    
    After running the python script, you will see a similar output in Cloud Shell:

    ![](images/execute-sec-assessment.png "Security Assessment output")

    The output of the script is displaying in the console which security services are enabled. After the script is executed and the output displayed in the console, a CSV file called “security\_assessment\_report.csv” is created automatically in a directory in the Cloud Shell with following format name: /<tenancy\_name\>\-<date\> and, at the same time, it is stored in your recently created bucket.

    This file is the OCI security assessment report generated by the Python script. If you want to know deeper about the script usage, please refer to the Appendix.


2. (Optional) Download and run the CIS Benchmark Compliance Assessment by running the following commands in Cloud Shell:
    
    ````
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/main/scripts/cis_reports.py
    ````  

    ````
    python3 cis_reports.py -dt --output-to-bucket cis_report
    ````  

    To know more about this script, please refer to: <https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart/blob/main/compliance-script.md>

## Task 2: Store reports in Autonomous Database

1. Now you need to upload the CSV files generated in your bucket to your recently created Autonomous Database. To do that, you have to call the table API that you have exposed. In the Cloud Shell terminal, run the following:

    ````
    curl -X POST '<your curl command location URL>/batchload?batchRows=500' -H 'Content-type: text/plain'  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' --data-binary @security_assessment_report.csv
    ````

    Where \<your curl command location URL> is the URL you noted down for your table, once you enabled it for REST.
    To verify that everything went well, you should have an output as following:

    ![](images/output-csv-adb.png "Successful API call")

2. (Optional) Same for CIS Summary report:

    ````
    curl -X POST '<your curl command location URL>/batchload?batchRows=500' -H 'Content-type: text/plain'  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' --data-binary @cis_summary_report.csv
    ````

3. (Optional) As a verification step, you can go back in the SQL tools by clicking Database Actions on your Autonomous Database, and log in as SECASSESSMENT user:  

    ![](images/database-actions.png "Database Actions")

NOTE: You may need to log in first as ADMIN, then Click Sign Out, and log in as SECASSESSMENT user.

Once you are logged in as SECASSESSMENT user, click SQL under Development:

   ![](images/click-sql.png "Click SQL")

Enter the following command in the SQL Web Developer (logged in as SECASSESSMENT user):

```
SELECT * from OCISECURITYCENTER;
```
and run the command in the picture below:

  ![](images/run.png "Run the command")

It should display the results, proving that the load of the data has been working correctly. You should have something similar to:

  ![](images/database-table.png "Database table")



## Task 3: Check your Security Dashboard

After the script is completely executed, and you loaded the CSV file in your Autonomous Database, you can log in to your APEX and the Security Dashboard appears. This dashboard is showing in a graphical format the security assessment report info.

1.	On the Autonomous Database dashboard, click on SecAssessments under Instance Name on APEX Instance section:

    ![](images/click-instance-name.png "Click Instance Name")

2.	Click Launch APEX.

    ![](images/launch-apex.png "Launch APEX")

3. The log in page for APEX will be prompted and you need to log in as SECASSESSMENT user.

    ![](images/log-in-as-secassessment.png "Log in as SECASSESSMENT")

4. Once you are logged in, click App Builder and the Security Dashboard application that you installed earlier. Click Run Application.

    ![](images/run-application.png "Run application")

5. Log in as SECASSESSMENT user in the application:

    ![](images/log-in-application.png "Log in to the application")

6. The OCI Security Assessment dashboard will appear. Click on the card to view your security assessment results.

    ![](images/secassessment-dashboard.png "OCI Security Assessment Dashboard")


7. Once you click, you will see the results obtained in the Security Assessment report in a table.

    In this section, you can easily see the suggestions in the OCI Security Assessment dashboard, to enable or not some security services according to your current implementation with three different options and colours:

    *	**Green**. Security services that are enabled.
    *	**Yellow**. Security services that were enabled but currently deleted for some reason.
    *	**Grey**. Security services that are not enabled and you may want to have a look.

    As an example, if all services are enabled, you will see something similar to:
  
    ![](images/results-table.png "Security assessment results")

    As well, at the bottom of the page you can see a button to be redirected to Oracle contacts page, in case you want to request an Oracle Security Workshop.
    
    After a review of the status of your security services enabled in your tenant, you may want to know more about them. In order to do that, you can click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner and a menu with different options showing the different security services will appear:

    ![](images/menu.png "Security services in OCI")
    
    Each section contains a description about each security service and three buttons with the following options:

    *	**Go to OCI Security Service Console**. Click here to implement the service manually in the OCI console.
    *	**Go to OCISecurity Service Documentation**. Click here to see more detailed information about the service.

    And in the Cloud Guard section, you also have the following button:

    *	**Turn on OCI Cloud Guard**. Click here to directly be redirected to Resource Manager service with the corresponding Terraform stack loaded to implement Cloud Guard.

    Pressing this button and see results will be the action performed in the next lab.

    You can play around and explore the different views of the dashboard. For example, for section OCI Cloud Guard:

    ![](images/cloud-guard-page.png "Cloud Guard")

    And for section OCI Vulnerability Scanning:

    ![](images/scanning-page.png "Vulnerability Scanning Service") 

     Even you can see the compliance reports in section Tenant CIS Compliance section, in case you performed the optional actions in the previous labs. You will see something similar to:


  *Note:* If you want to re-run the scripts and reload the tables, before running the curl command again, you need to empty the tables first in the SQL tool. For this run the following command then the “select” to verify it’s empty:

    ````
    truncate table OCISECURITYCENTER;
    select * from OCISECURITYCENTER;
    ````
    ````
    truncate table OCICISCOMPLIANCECHECK;
    select * from OCICISCOMPLIANCECHECK;
    ````
