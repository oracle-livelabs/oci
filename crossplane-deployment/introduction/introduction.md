# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, we will guide you through an automated deployment process that sets up the Crossplane OCI Provider along with its dependencies on an OCI instance. This instance will act as the operator node, responsible for managing your Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) environment and provisioning OCI resources seamlessly. The automation will be run using OCI Resource Manager.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a strong understanding of how to use Crossplane to manage OCI infrastructure declaratively and programmaticallyâ€”without relying on direct interactions with the OCI Console or Kubernetes.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Deploy the OCI Crossplane Provider on OCI with Resource Manager
* Manage OCI Infrastructure with the OCI Crossplane Provider

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator permissions or the necessary permissions to manage the OCI tenancy
