# Scheduling and Orchestration

## Introduction

Learn how to **run a Data Integration task**, create a **task schedule** in your OCI Data Integration application, and to **run it**.

After publishing tasks to an Application, you can run a task **manually on-demand**, or you can use schedules and task schedules to **automate the execution** of your tasks.
To run a task automatically on a specific schedule, you must:
* **Create a schedule**: A schedule defines when and how frequently tasks should be run. A schedule can be used across tasks of any type.
* **Create a task schedule for the task**: A task schedule is an automated run configuration for a specific task. You schedule a task to run automatically by creating a task schedule, and associating the task schedule with an existing schedule.


### Objectives
* Create and publish a Data Integration task
* Manage Data Integration application tasks
* Create a Schedule

### Prerequisites

* Completion of the preceding tasks in the Lab1
* Some understanding of Cloud, Database, Data Lake terms is helpful 
* Familiarity with ETL concepts is helpful

## Task 1: Create and publish tasks

1. Once you are in the OCI console, click on the left hand top left menu, go to **Analytics & AI** and then click on **Data Lake**.

2. Go to the Data Lake assigned to you.

3. Click on the **Data Integration** menu on the left hand menu.

4. Click on the **Data Integration home** button as shown below.

5. Click on the **Projects** menu as shown below.

6. Once in the project listing page, click on the project that is assigned to you, for example: **user 1** from **group 1** will work in **DataLakePrjUser1**.

7. We will now create a OCI Data Flow task. Click on the **Tasks** menu in the left hand side, then click on **Create Task** and then select **OCI Data Flow** as shown below.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-task.png " ")

8. In the name field input **DataPrepTask** and then click on Select in **OCI Data Flow Application** block as shown below.

9. In the following screen select the compartment **"CloudWorld_Shared"**, this will populate a table with all Data Flow applications in the compartment, select **DataPrepGrp1** based on the group number you belong to and then click on **Select** as shown below.

10. Then click on **Validate**, wait for successful validation, then click on **Create and close**.

11. This will take you to the Tasks page, click on the action menu on the right and then click on **Publish to application**.

12. Select the application assigned to you, if you are from group 1 user 1, the application will end with the string User1.

## Task 2: Manage Application tasks and Scheduling

1. A notification will pop up on the right top corner click on **"View Application"**.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-application-view.png " ")

2. Make sure you are in the **Tasks** section and click on the action menu for the newly published task and click on **Schedule**.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-application-tasks.png " ")

3. Now we will create a task schedule. In the slide in window for creating task schedule give the task schedule a name: **DataPrepTask_TaskSchedule**, then scroll down to the Schedule block and click on select as shown below.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-task-schedule.png " ")

4. Next we will create a schedule, click on **Create Schedule** button.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-create-schedule.png " ")

5. In the Create schedule page, give the schedule a name, select Time zone as per your preference, select the frequency and time and click on create as shown below.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-create-schedule1.png " ")

6. You will be redirected to the create schedule page, make sure the newly created schedule is selected and click on **Select**.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-select-schedule.png " ")

7. Verify the schedule information and click on create and close.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-verify-schedule.png " ")

8. You will get a notification on the top right corner of the screen for successful creation of the schedule as shown below.

  ![Oracle Cloud Console, Data Integration](./images/data-integration-schedule-success-message.png " ")

You have successfully scheduled the task and the same will run at the selected frequency and time. 

   **Congratulations!**
