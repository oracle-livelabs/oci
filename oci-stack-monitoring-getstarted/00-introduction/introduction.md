# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will become familiar with Oracle's Stack Monitoring. Stack Monitoring is cloud-native service to monitor and view the health and performance of applications and the underlying tech stack. Stack Monitoring can discover and monitor resources running both within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) or on-premises.

Using Stack Monitoring's Enterprise Summary, you will learn to identify application outages across your enterprise at a glance. Identify and triage all open alarms. Leverage Stack Monitoring's Key Performance Metrics (KPI's) organized into tiers to review performance outliers. And finally learn to dynamically configure the Enterprise Summary to meet your needs in the moment. This is helpful if you need to swap a metric chart or table with another to troubleshoot an alarm that is not displayed out of the box.

You will also become familiar with Stack Monitoring's homepages. Learn how to triage open alarms and view metric performance over time. Become familiar with using Stack Monitoring's application topology and troubleshoot issues across an application stack. And finally, leverage Stack Monitoring's **Stack View** to get a holistic perspective of key performance metrics across an entire E-Business Suite application.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes
