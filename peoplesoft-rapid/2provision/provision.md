# Provision the PeopleSoft Application

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create your PeopleSoft application by provisioning the application from the OCI  Marketplace image for PeopleSoft.

Estimated Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

### Objectives

To deploy the PeopleSoft Instance, in this lab, you will:
*   Launch & deploy an instance of PeopleSoft from Marketplace
*   Access PeopleSoft instance

### Prerequisites
* A user with 'manage' access to Networking and Compute, compartment, and marketplace access
* SSH key
* VCN setup from the previous lab

## Task 1:  Launch PeopleSoft instance from OCI marketplace

1. Make sure you are on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console

2. Navigate to ***Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace*** by using the dropdown menu on the left side of your screen and clicking the ***Marketplace*** and then all applications.

  ![From the menu bar in the OCI console, click on Marketplace](./images/oci-marketplace.png " ")

3. In the search bar type in PeopleSoft and hit search. There are 6 PeopleSoft DEMO environments that can be installed
   
    * PeopleSoft HCM
    * PeopleSoft FSCM
    * PeopleSoft ELM
    * PeopleSoft CRM
    * PeopleSoft Campus Solutions
    * PeopleSoft Interaction Hub

  ![Select any of the PeopleSoft images to install](./images/select-psft-image.png " ")


4. On the instance page, select the PeopleSoft HCM Update Image Demo version and then select the compartment you made earlier. Then click ***Launch Instance***

  ![Select the desired compartment, then select Launch Instance](./images/config-psft-image.png " ")

5. On the Create Compute Instance page you will need to fill in additional info for your Instance

    a.  **Name:** You can name it whatever you like, such as "psfthcm"

    b.  **Select compartment:** Select the compartment that you created earlier

    c.  **Placement:** You can leave this as it is by default for this Lab

    d.   For the next **Configure networking** section you will choose the ***SELECT EXISTING VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK*** option and choose the ***SELECT EXISTING SUBNET*** option before selecting the Network and Subnet you created in the previous lab

    Make sure that ***ASSIGN A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS*** is also selected since we will use this to deploy our PeopleSoft application

    e. **Add SSH keys:** Here you will need to select the ssh key you created earlier. You can either use the

    *   ***CHOOSE PUBLIC KEY FILES*** and open the public key file you made if you know its location

        or you can use the

    *   ***PASTE PUBLIC KEYS*** and paste the data within the key file if you have the file open

    

    

    ![Fill in desired name, compartment, AD, and leave everything else as is](./images/create-compute-psft-image.png " ")
    ![Select the existing compute shape e.g. VM Standard 2.1](./images/compute-shape.png " ")
    ![Select existing virtual cloud network; select existing subnet, select assign a public IP address](./images/compute-network-config.png " ")
   
    f.  **Configure boot volume:** change the size from default to 300GB

    ![Provide the ssh key created earlier and set boot volume size as 300GB](./images/config-ssh-boot-volume.png " ")

    g. Click Show advanced options, on the management tab, select the option Paste cloud-init script, and enter the configuration information using the JSON format in these examples.

             
          <copy>{
          "connect_pwd":  "password",
          "access_pwd":  "password",
          "admin_pwd":  "password",
          "weblogic_admin_pwd":  "password",
          "webprofile_user_pwd":  "password",
          "gw_user_pwd":  "password",
          "domain_conn_pwd":  "password",
          "opr_pwd": "password"
          }</copy
          
     connect_pwd - Ensure the password is between 6 and 30 characters in length. It must not contain any space, percent sign (%), slash (/), single quotation mark ( '), or double quotation mark (") characters.

     access_pwd  - Ensure the password is no more than 8 characters in length. The first character must be a letter, and the remaining 7 characters may be a mixture of letters and numbers.

     admin_pwd  - Ensure the password is between 8 and 30 characters in length. It must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character, either underscore ( _ ), dash (-), or number sign (#).

     weblogic\_admin\_pwd - Ensure that the password is between 8 and 30 characters in length with at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter. It must also contain one number or one special character (!@#$%^&).

     webprofile\_user\_pwd - Ensure the password contains only alphanumeric characters and is between 8 and 30 characters in length.

     gw\_user\_pwd - The password is not validated, but Oracle recommends that passwords include 8 or more characters

     domain\_conn\_pwd - Ensure the password contains only alphanumeric characters and is between 8 and 30 characters in length.

     opr_pwd - Ensure the password contains only alphanumeric characters and is no more than 8 characters in length.


    ![Provide the custom cloud-init script in the management tab](./images/cloud-init-script.png " ")
    h. Now review your settings and click ***Create*** at the bottom of the page when you are ready
6. Now you will be taken to the Instance Page, and will see that your newly created instance is provisioning

     Once you see the small orange box change to green, your instance will have provisioned successfully and now you can move onto the next step in the Lab

     ![Once the orange box changes to a green box, your instance will have been successfully provisioned](./images/compute-provisioning.png " ")
     ![Compute instance successfully provisioned](./images/compute-provisioned.png " ")

 *Important:* The compute VM might take around 2 hours to completely install and configure the PeopleSoft environment.
## Task 2: Access the PeopleSoft Application 



1. The PeopleSoft OCI marketplace image can be accessed by logging in with the below URL and port number. 

       ```
       http://<fully-qualified-hostname>:8000/
       ```



  **NOTE:** Before you access the fully qualified hostname or fully qualified domain name (FQDN), it is necessary to add the FQDN or fully qualified hostname of the compute VM in the etc hosts file
  
  For example, if you are a Windows user or MAC user, you can navigate to the below path on the system as an administrator and modify the hosts file with the below entries.
   
    * Windows hosts file path - C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    * Mac hosts file path - /private/etc/hosts


         ```
        IP address    fully-qualified-hostname
         ```
        ![Hosts file entry, sample from windows](./images/hosts-file.png " ")
  
  The URL you will need to type into your browser's search bar should look like this:



      http://psfthcm.sub05021003250.testvcn.oraclevcn.com:8000/

    

    ![Type the appropriate URL into the Firefox search bar or Chrome](./images/psft-web.png " ")

    The login user-id for PeopleSoft HCM application is PS; the password was supplied during the cloud-init script for opr_pwd

    ![Look and feel of PeopleSoft HCM after login](./images/psft-web-login.png " ")
    

## Summary

In this lab, you launched an instance of PeopleSoft from the OCI marketplace, deployed the PeopleSoft application, and then accessed the PeopleSoft Application.

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
