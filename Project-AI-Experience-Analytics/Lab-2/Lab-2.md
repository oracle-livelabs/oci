# AI Powered Analytics with Oracle Fusion AI Data Platform

## Introduction

Oracle Fusion AI Data Platform (FUSION AIDP) Platform is a suite of prebuilt, cloud-native analytics applications designed for Oracle Cloud Applications. It delivers ready-to-use insights that help line-of-business users make better decisions and drive business performance.
Built on Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, the Fusion AIDP provides best-practice Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and in-depth analyses that empower both decision-makers and individual contributors.

The service begins with Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, which can be rapidly deployed, personalized, and extended. It automatically extracts data from these applications and loads it into an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse instance. Business users can then create and tailor dashboards in Oracle Analytics Cloud, leveraging AI-powered, self-service analytics for data preparation, visualization, reporting, augmented analysis, and natural language queries.

This lab enables business users to explore data, investigate trends, and uncover patterns or outliers, helping them turn insights into action.
