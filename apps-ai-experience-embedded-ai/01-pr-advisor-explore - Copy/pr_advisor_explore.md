# Exploring a pre-built agent

## Introduction

In this exercise we will learn about the overall capabilities of Fusion AI Agent Studio by reviewing the out of the box tools, business objects, deep links, prompts, topics, and Agent types

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

Understand the structure of a pre-built agent and agent tools in AI Agent Studio

### Usage Notes

When creating agents and teams in Fusion AI Agent Studio, all components must have a unique name.

To ensure your components have a unique name, please use an initial code when naming your components.

Take the first two letters of your first name and last two letters of your last name to form a unique code.  If this spells out a common word, add a number.

> **EXAMPLE:** <br/>
> ***TI***M SULLIV***AN*** = ***TIAN*** <br/>
> ***CO***RY WA***DE*** = ***CODE2***

Once you have chosen a code, use it consistently to ensure you can easily find your components
