# Set up Highly Available and Secure Infrastructure with Terraform on OCI

## About this Workshop

This Lab will show you how to set up a highly available web server architecture on OCI.

We will show how to set up a VCN, Load Balancer, Bastion, and 2 Compute Instances with Terraform.

We will provide the Terraform environment and give a step by step guide on how to set it up on a Tenancy.

Here is the Architecture Diagram of our infrastructure we will be provisioning on OCI.
