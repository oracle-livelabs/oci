# Configure Secure Firewalls

## Introduction

In this lab you will be configuring Secure Firewalls instances initial configuration, interfaces, routes, ssh-interfaces health check and route tables to support traffic between VCNs. You have deployed Firewall Management Center(FMC) to manage Secure Firewalls configuration. You have also used **cloud-init** to pass FMC IP address, registration key and NAT ID.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes.

### Objectives

- Initial Configuration on Firewall Management Center
- Initial Configuration on Secure Firewall First Instance
- Initial Configuration on Secure Firewall Second Instance

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)  

## **Task 1: Initial Configuration on Firewall Management Center**

1. Connect to **FMC1** instance public IP over ssh. You will be creating initial password so you can connect to FMC over browser.

    - SSH to Firewall Management Center using **admin** user with your private key associated with this instance.
    - Enter password to manage Firewall Management Center using browser, In this case you have entered **Cisco@123** password. 

      ![](../common/images/59-FMC-Initial-Config.png " ")

2. Connect to **fmc1** instance public IP on your local machine's web browser: **https://public_ip**. It will ask you to enter **username/password**, enter **admin/Cisco@123** or your password which you have configured in **step#1**.

3. Select **Start 90-Day evaluation period without registration** for the time being but at a later stage if you want to add a license you can do. For this lab you will use 90 days trial license.

4. Click **Save** to apply 90 days license to your FMC. 

5. [Optional] Connect to **secureFirewall1** instance public IP over ssh. Since you are using Firewall Management Center to manage Secure Firewalls. You can check firewall manager as below: 

    - SSH to Secure Firewall using **admin** user with your private key associated with this instance.
    - Enter command **show managers** this should reflect manager which you added or populated during instance creation. Value should be **pending**:

6. [Optional] Connect to **secureFirewall2** instance public IP over ssh. Since you are using Firewall Management Center to manage Secure Firewalls. You can check firewall manager as below:

    - SSH to Secure Firewall using **admin** user with your private key associated with this instance.
    - Enter command **show managers** this should reflect manager which you added or populated during instance creation. Value should be **pending**:

      ![](../common/images/58-First-Time-SecureFirewall-SSH-Login.png " ")

7. Navigate to **Devices > Add > Device** to add your **secureFirewall1** instance. 

      ![](../common/images/63-Device-Registration.png " ")

8. Click on **Device** and fill out the dialog box for **Device Registration**:

      - **Host**: Enter SecureFirewall1 Instance Public IP
      - **Display Name**: Enter User-Friendly Name
      - **Registration Key**: Enter Registration Key associated with **secureFirewall1** instance which is used in **cloud-init** configuration; Example: **cisco123reg1**
      - **Access Control Policy**:
        - Click on **Create New Policy** icon and it will open a dialog box; enter policy name and description and select **Block Traffic** from options.
      - **Performance Tier**
        - Select appropriate version from drop-down, in your case you can also select **FTDv - Variable** 
        - Enable Check marks to Malware, Threat and URL Filtering
      - **Unique NAT ID**: Enter NAT ID associated with **secureFirewall1** instance which is used in **cloud-init** configuration; Example: **cisco123nat1**

      ![](../common/images/64-SecureFirewall1-Policy-Initial.png " ")

      ![](../common/images/64-SecureFirewall1-Policy-Initial-2.png " ")

9. Click on **Register** button to add your device to FMC. 

    ![](../common/images/64-SecureFirewall1-Policy-Initial-3.png " ")

10. [Optional] We have noticed sometimes while registering device if FMC is not fully up yet it might try to de-register device itself when you register device first time. So you can add manager again on each Secure Firewall instance using below command over SSH: 

      ```
      <copy>
        configure manager add <fmc_public_ip> <registration_key> <nat_id>
        end
      </copy>
      ```

      - **Host**: Enter SecureFirewall2 Instance Public IP
      - **Display Name**: Enter User-Friendly Name
      - **Registration Key**: Enter Registration Key associated with **secureFirewall2** instance which is used in **cloud-init** configuration; Example: **cisco123reg2**
      - **Access Control Policy**: Select **Block Traffic** policy created from drop-down.

        - Select appropriate version from drop-down, in your case you can also select **FTDv - Variable** 
        - Enable Check marks to Malware, Threat and URL Filtering
      - **Unique NAT ID**: Enter NAT ID associated with **secureFirewall2** instance which is used in **cloud-init** configuration; Example: **cisco123nat2**
