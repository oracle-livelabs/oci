# Deploy Secure Firewall and Supporting Configuration

## Introduction

In this lab you will be creating Firewall Management Center, Secure Firewall instances from **partner images** or **marketplace** service, adding additional interfaces and flexible network load balancers to support traffic between VCNs.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

- Launch Firewall Management Center in Hub VCN
- Launch Secure Firewall Instances in Hub VCN 
- Add Interfaces to Secure Firewall Instances
- Demonstrate launching Flexible Network Load Balancer and supporting configuration
- Demonstrate updating routing tables 
- Validate route tables association

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- Access to Oracle Cloud Marketplace **BYOL** listings.
     - **Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMCv)**
     - **Cisco Firepower NGFW virtual firewall (NGFWv)**

## Task 1: Launch Firewall Management Center Instance

1. Launch **Cloud Shell** by clicking the icon next to region name on top right of OCI console. ('<=' icon)

2. Once cloud Shell is launched. Enter command **ssh-keygen**, press enter for all prompts. This will create a ssh key pair. Enter command.

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      cd .ssh
      cat id_rsa.pub
      </copy>
      ```
   
   Copy the key displayed. This will be used when creating the compute instance.

3. From OCI services menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute**.
 
4. On the left sidebar, select the **Compartment** in which you placed your VCN under **List Scope**. The, Click **Create Instance**. You will be creating **1** instance as per below table: 

    | Name      | Placement | Image                                                |  Version | Shape          | Network      | Subnet      | Add SSH-Keys                |
    | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
    | fmc1| AD1       | Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMCv) BYOL | 7.0.0-94    | VMStandard2.2  | firewall-vcn | mgmt-subnet | Yours/CloudShell Public Key |
    
5. Enter a **Name** for your Instance and the **Compartment** in which you placed your **Firewall VCN**. Fill out the dialog box. Select appropriate values based on table shared in previous **#4**. Click on **Partner Image Agreement** check box and save image selection by clicking on **Select Image** button.

6. Select Shape **VM Standard2.2** as default value.

7. Scroll Down to **Networking** and verify the following.
      - Your Compartment is selected
      - The VCN created is populated: **firewall-vcn**
      - The subnet created is populated: **mgmt-subnet**
      - Enable Public IP Address assignment: **Assign a public IPv4 address**

   ![Detailed Page of Creating Cisco FMC in Hub VCN](../common/images/fmc1-hub-vcn-instance.png " ")

8. Ensure **PASTE PUBLIC KEYS** is selected under **Add SSH Keys**. Paste the public key copied earlier.
 
   **NOTE:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different shape from VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1 OR choose a different AD.

   **NOTE:** If you already have your ssh-key available you can skip copying from cloud-shell and paste your own public key and use private key associated to that for accessing instance.

9. Click **Create** and wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. 

## Task 2: Launch Secure Firewall Instances

1. Launch **Cloud Shell** by clicking the icon next to region name on top right of OCI console. ('<=' icon)

2. Once cloud Shell is launched. Enter command **ssh-keygen**, press enter for all prompts. This will create a ssh key pair. Enter command.

      ```
      <copy>
      bash
      cd .ssh
      cat id_rsa.pub
      </copy>
      ```
   
   Copy the key displayed. This will be used when creating the compute instance.

3. From OCI services menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute**.
 
4. On the left sidebar, select the **Compartment** in which you placed your VCN under **List Scope**. The, Click **Create Instance**. You will be creating **2** instances as per below table:

9. Click on **Show advanced options** button below **Boot Volume** section and select **Paste cloud-init script** where you will be pasting a cloud-init script which will allow you to manage **Secure Firewall** via **Firewall Management Center**

    You need to update values for each variable in below cloud-init script for each instance: 

    | Variable      | Example           | Comment                       |
    |---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
    | Hostname      | firewall-name     | Secure Firewall Instance Name |
    | AdminPassword | Cisco@1234        | Admin Password                |
    | FmcIp         | 132.145.135.38    | FMC IP to Manage Firewalls; Instance which you created in step1    |
    | FmcRegKey     | cisco123reg       | Firewall Registration Key     |
    | FmcNatId      | cisco123nat       | Firewall Nat Id               |

    An example of **SecureFirewall1** would be this: 

      ```
      <copy>
      {
        "Hostname": "secure-firewall1",
        "AdminPassword": "Cisco@1234",
        "FirewallMode": "routed",

        "FmcNatId": "cisco123nat1"
       }
      </copy>
      ```

10. Click **Create** and wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. 

11. Repeat step 5 to 10 based on the **table** provided in **step 4** for another Secure Firewall **secureFirewall2** instance.

    An example of **SecureFirewall2** **cloud-init** would be something like this:

      <copy>
      {
        "Hostname": "secure-firewall1",
        "AdminPassword": "Cisco@1234",
        "FirewallMode": "routed",
        "IPv4Mode": "dhcp",
        "ManageLocally":"No",
        "FmcIp": "132.145.135.38",
        "FmcRegKey": "cisco123reg2",
        "FmcNatId": "cisco123nat2"
