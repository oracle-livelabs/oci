# Traffics Validation

## Introduction

In this lab you will be creating required security policies, NAT policies on Secure Firewalls to support different use-case and validate traffics between and from VCNs. 

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes.

### Objectives

- Validate North-South Inbound
- Validate North-South Outbound
- Validate East-West (Web to Database & Database to Web)
- Validate East-West Traffic (Web & DB Application to Oracle Services Network)

**Please Read:** For each traffic flow scenario, ensure that network address translation (NAT) and security policies are configured on the Firewalls. The currently supported **Flexible Network Load Balancer** use case requires that you enable **source NAT** on the firewalls from which traffic is exiting.

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)

## **Task 1: North-South Inbound Traffic**

1. Connect to **FMC1** Firewall Management Center public IP on your local machine's web browser: **https://public_ip** using **admin/Cisco@123** or **password** which you have setup in **Lab3**

2. Navigate to **Policies > Access Control** and click on pencil icon to update **BlockAll** policy name as **TrafficPolicies** and click on **Save**:

3. Add a new rule by clicking on **+ Add Rule** button preset on your **TrafficPolicies** screen. Fill out the dialog box and save configuration by clicking on **+ Add** button:
      - In this lab you will allow all but in production environment make sure you open only required rules. 

    Enter the following information and accept all the defaults
       - **Name**: Enter a user-friendly name; AllowAll
       - **Logging**: Enable Logging
         - Enable check marks to **Log at Beginning of Connection** and **Log at End of Connection**

9. Navigate to **FMC Console** and based on below table create a static route for your **Object Storage Networks** within your **region** on each device i.e. **SecureFirewall1** and **SecureFirewall2**: 

   | Interface              | Selected Network                                                    | Gateway                           | Comment                                                                        |
   |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | inside                 | New Address Object; object-storage-network with 134.70.0.0/16 value | inside-subnet-gateway 192.168.3.1 | Ensure that you add Object Storage Networks addresses range as per your region |

10. Below image shows value for **SecureFirewall1** instance: 

   ![](../common/images/75-Verify-OSN-Config-1.png " ")

11. Below image shows value for **SecureFirewall2** instance:

12. Do a sanity check to confirm routes are added successfully on both Secure Firewall instances: 

   ![](../common/images/75-Verify-OSN-Config-2.png " ")

13. Create a **NAT Rule** in your existing policy to ensure that traffic from inside towards Object Storage Networks gets **source NATed** to inside interface IP address. Click on **Add Rule** and add a rule at position **#2**. Fill out the dialog box: 

    Enter the following information and accept all the defaults:
       - **Type**: Static
