## Task 5: High Availability Failover Validation

1. Navigate to **CloudGuard1** instance attached VNIC details page and verify that **Frontend/Primary** and/or **Backend** interface has floating secondary IPs are available on primary instance.

   ![](../common/images/86-CloudGuard1-Frontend-Floating-IP.png " ")

2. Since you are using **R81** release there is an additional step which you need to ensure that HA failover happens successfully. Go to **expert** mode and run below commands on each **CloudGuard1** and **CloudGuard2** instances over SSH:

      ```
      <copy>
      set expert-password
      Enter a Unique Password, for example: Check@123
      expert
      $FWDIR/scripts/merge-bundle.sh
      $FWDIR/scripts/cloud_ha_cli.py restart
      </copy>
      ```

   Below image shows an example of above script on **CloudGuard1** instance. You have to make sure that you run on both CloudGuard instances.

      ![](../common/images/HA-Failover-Config-1.png " ")

4. You can manually trigger HA failover using provided commands as below: 

      ```
      <copy>
      #### To bring down Cluster Member 
      set cluster member admin down 
      show cluster state 

      #### To bring back up Cluster Member 
      set cluster member admin up 
      show cluster state 
      </copy>
      ```

   Example: Below image reflect HA failover from **CloudGuard1** instance to **CloudGuard2** instance: 

   ![](../common/images/failover-validation.png " ")


   Or you can also Reboot **CloudGuard1** instance from OCI console to trigger failover automatically to **CloudGuard2** instance.

   ![](../common/images/87-Reboot-CloudGuard1.png " ")

5. Within few seconds **CloudGuard2** instance should become **Active** Firewall. You can also see on **SmartConsole** GUI where **CloudGuard2** instance became primary firewall.

   ![](../common/images/88-Failover-CloudGuard2.png " ")

6. Navigate to **CloudGuard2** instance attached VNIC details page and verify that **Frontend/Primary** and/or **Backend** interface floating IPs has moved from **CloudGuard1** instance.

   ![](../common/images/90-Failover-Success-CloudGuard2-frontend.png " ")

   ![](../common/images/91-Failover-Success-CloudGuard2-backend.png " ")

7. You can verify that **CloudGuard2** is primary and **CloudGuard1** is secondary in your cluster:

   ![](../common/images/89-Failover-Success-CloudGuard1.png " ")
