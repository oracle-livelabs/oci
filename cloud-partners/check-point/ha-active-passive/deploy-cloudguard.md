## Introduction

In this lab you will be creating CloudGuard instances from **partner images** i.e. **OCI Marketplace**, adding additional interfaces, IP Addresses, dynamic group and policy to support traffic between VCNs.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

- Launch CloudGuard Instances in Hub VCN
- Add Interfaces to CloudGuard Instances
- Assign Secondary IP Addresses to Primary CloudGuard Instance
- Demonstrate launching Dynamic Groups and Policies
- Demonstrate updating routing tables
- Validate route tables association

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)
- Oracle Marketplace Listings Access required for this **Lab**:
    - **CloudGuard Security Management** BYOL listing
    - **CloudGuard Next-Gen Firewall with Threat Prevention and SandBlast** BYOL listing
        - You would need a valid license from Check Point if you chose BYOL listing once trail license is expired.

## Task 1: Launch CloudGuard Security Management and CloudGuard Instances

1. Launch **Cloud Shell** by clicking the icon next to region name on top right of OCI console. ('<=' icon)

2. Once cloud Shell is launched. Enter command **ssh-keygen**, press enter for all prompts. This will create a ssh key pair. Enter command.

    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    cd .ssh
    cat id_rsa.pub
    </copy>
    ```

    Copy the key displayed. This will be used when creating the compute instance.

3. From OCI services menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute**.

4. On the left sidebar, select the **Compartment** in which you placed your VCN under **List Scope**. Then Click **Create Instance**. You will be creating **3** instances as per below table in respective order:

    | Name      | Placement | Image                                                |  Version | Shape          | Network      | Subnet      | Add SSH-Keys                |
    | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
    | CheckPointManager| AD1       | Partner Image: CloudGuard Security Management - BOYL | R81_rev1.0         | VMStandard2.2  | firewall-vcn | frontend-subnet | Yours/CloudShell Public Key |
    | CloudGuard1| AD1       | Partner Image: CloudGuard Next-Gen Firewall with Threat Prevention and SandBlast - BOYL | R81_rev1.0         | VMStandard2.2  | firewall-vcn | frontend-subnet | Yours/CloudShell Public Key |
    | CloudGuard2| AD2       | Partner Image: CloudGuard Next-Gen Firewall with Threat Prevention and SandBlast - BOYL | R81_rev1.0         | VM Standard2.2 | firewall-vcn | frontend-subnet | Yours/CloudShell Public Key |

5. Enter a **Name** for your Instance and the **Compartment** in which you placed your **Firewall VCN**. Fill out the dialog box. Select appropriate values based on table shared in previous **step#4**. Click on **Partner Image Agreement** check box and save image selection by clicking on **Select Image** button.

6. Select Shape **VM Standard2.2** as default value.

7. Scroll Down to **Networking** and verify the following.

    - Your Compartment is selected
    - The VCN created is populated: **firewall-vcn**
    - The subnet created is populated: **frontend-subnet**
    - Enable Public IP Address assignment: **Assign a public IPv4 address**

     ![Detailed Page of Creating Primary Firewall Compute Instance in Firewall Hub VCN](../common/images/check-point-manager.png " ")

8. Ensure **PASTE PUBLIC KEYS** is selected under **Add SSH Keys**. Paste the public key copied earlier.

   **Note:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different compatible shape from VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1 OR choose a different AD.

   **Note:** If you already have your ssh-key available you can skip copying from cloud-shell and paste your own public key and use private key associated to that for accessing instance.

9. Click **Create** and wait for Instance to be in **Running** state.

10. Repeat step 5 to 9 based on the **table** provided in **step#4** for CloudGuard instances: **cloudguard1 and cloudguard2** .
