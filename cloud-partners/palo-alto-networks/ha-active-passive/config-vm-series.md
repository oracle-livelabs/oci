# Configure VM Series Firewalls

## Introduction

In this lab you will be configuring VM Series Firewall firewalls initial configuration, hostnames, interfaces, high availability, external OCI connector and route tables to support traffic between VCNs.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes.

### Objectives

- Initial Configuration on Primary VM Series Firewall
- Initial Configuration on Secondary VM Series Firewall

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure paid account credentials (User, Password, Tenant, and Compartment)  

## **Task 1: Initial Configuration on Primary VM Series Firewall**

1. Setup initial **admin** user password using **CLI**. Connect to **vm-series-firewall-1** instance using your ssh private key which you used earlier via **admin** user:  

      ```
      <copy>
      ssh -i private-key-path admin@vm-series-firewall-1-mgmt-public-ip
      </copy>
      ```

2. Once you login successfully, you need to setup **admin** password so you can login to GUI. Enter **configure** command to configuration mode. Run below command and setup password. In your case you can hose **PaloAlto@1234** as password example or your unique password. 

      ```
      <copy>
      configure 
      set mgt-config users admin password
      </copy>
      ```
3. Once you confirm password, make sure to commit your change using **commit** command on the same shell prompt. Below snippet shows an **example** of setting initial password.

4. Connect to **VM-Series-Firewall-1** instance public IP on your local machine's web browser: **https://public_ip**. It will ask you to enter username/password so enter **admin/PaloAlto@1234** or the password which you picked in **step2** earlier.

   ![](../common/images/106-Firewall-Device-Import-Config-2.png " ")

11. Click on **Import named configuration snapshot** and browse your local file which you just updated with required variable. 

   ![](../common/images/107-Firewall-Local-Xml-File.png " ")

12. Click on **Load named configuration snapshot** and select the file which you just imported. 

   ![](../common/images/108-Firewall-Local-Load-Xml-File.png " ")

13. Do a sanity check and verify that configuration which you are trying to push to Firewall is correct: 

    - **Interfaces**
      
      ![](../common/images/109-Firewall-Initial-Push-Sanity-Check1.png " ")

    - **Security Policies**

      ![](../common/images/111-Firewall-Initial-Push-Sanity-Check3.png " ")

14. Commit your changes to **vm-series-firewall-1** instance and it should be successful: 

   ![](../common/images/114-Firewall-Initial-Commit.png " ")

   ![](../common/images/115-Firewall-Initial-Commit-Success.png " ")

15. You can verify configuration by navigating to **interfaces**, **policies** etc section. For example, below image shows interfaces are created successfully: 

   ![](../common/images/120-Firewall1-Hostname.png " ")

   ![](../common/images/116-Firewall-Initial-Commit-Sanity-Check.png " ")

16. You need to enable **Jumbo Frame** so to enable that navigate: **Device > Setup > Session** and check mark **Enable Jumbo Frame** option:

   ![](../common/images/124-Enable-Jumbo-Frame.png " ")

17. You must reboot the device to reflect jumbo frame changes. You can do that from OCI console or using **Operations > Reboot Device** option within your **vm-series-firewall-1** GUI. 

   ![](../common/images/125-Reboot-Device.png " ")

## **Task 2: Initial Configuration on Secondary VM Series Firewall**
