# Intergration of Landing Zone with Mushop Service

In this lab exercise, you will walk through the process of integration of Landing Zone with the third party microservices. MuShop represents a showcase of many OCI Cloud Native services as a unified reference application. Mushop is a set of micro services which implement e-commerce platforms on the OCI solution, and its resources will be used to integrate with the OCI Landing Zone.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

*  Login to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
* Create a New Stack under the Resource Manager. 
    Hamburger > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks > Create Stack
* Upload the mushop-basic-stack-latest.zip file that was downloaded earlier, and provide a name and description for the stack

* Note: in case of quota/service limit/permission issues, Apply job will fail and partial resources will be provisioned. Click on Destroy button will trigger the job to remove provisioned resources.

## Task 3: Cleanup

With the use of Terraform, the Resource Manager stack is also responsible for terminating the application.

Follow these steps to completely remove all provisioned resources:

    Home > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks
* Select the stack created previously to open the Stack Details view
* From the Stack Details, select Terraform Actions > Destroy

![MuShop Delete](.//images/mushop-delete.png)

* Confirm the Destroy job when prompted

The job status will be In Progress while resources are terminated
Once the destroy job has succeeded, return to the Stack Details page
Click Delete Stack and confirm when prompted

## Task 4: Known Issue 

* In case of quota/service limit/permission issues, Apply job will fail and partial resources will be provisioned. Click on Destroy button will trigger the job to remove provisioned resources.
* Sometimes DB provisioning is not allowed in the tenanacy , in this case Job will fail. Click on Destroy button will trigger the job to remove provisioned resources.
