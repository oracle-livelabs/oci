## Intergration of Oracle Enterprise Landing Zone with Mushop Service

In this lab exercise, you will walk through the process of integration of Landing Zone with the third party microservices. MuShop represents a showcase of many OCI Cloud Native services as a unified reference application. Mushop is a set of micro services which implement e-commerce platforms on the OCI solution, and its resources will be used to integrate with the OCI Landing Zone.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

    Learn the process of intergration of thrid party app with the Landing Zone.

### Prerequisites

    An Oracle Free Tier(Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
    User that belongs to the Administrator group or has granted privileges to manage multiple OCI resources (IAM, ORM, Network, etc) and Database Service.

## Task 1: Installation

This is a Terraform configuration that deploys the MuShop basic sample application on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][oci] and is designed to run using only the Always Free tier resources.

Mushop Topology Details
![Topology](.//images/mushop-topology.png)

The repository contains the application code as well as the [Terraform][tf] code to create a [Resource Manager][orm] stack, that creates all the required resources and configures the application on the created resources. To simplify getting started, the Resource Manager Stack is created as part of each [release](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative/releases)


The steps below guide you through deploying the application on your tenancy using the OCI Resource Manager.

1. Download the latest [`mushop-basic-stack-latest.zip`](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative/releases/latest/download/mushop-basic-stack-latest.zip) file.
2. [Login](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create) to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to import the stack
    > `Home > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks > Create Stack`
    ![mushop_stack](.//images/mushop-create-stack.png)
3. Upload the `mushop-basic-stack-latest.zip` file that was downloaded earlier, and provide a name and description for the stack
    ![mushop_stack_zip](.//images/mushop-upload-zip-file.png)
    ![mushop_stack_var](.//images/mushop-upload-zip-var-name.png)
4. Configure the stack
   1. **Database Name** - You can choose to provide a database name (optional)
   2. **Node Count** - Select if you want to deploy one or two application instances.
   3. **SSH Public Key** - (Optional) Provide a public SSH key if you wish to establish SSH access to the compute node(s).

   ![mushop_configure_stack4](.//images/mushop-lb-advanced-resource-options.png)
   ![mushop_configure_stack5](.//images/mushop-create-stack.png)
5. Review the information and click Create button.

   > The upload can take a few seconds, after which you will be taken to the newly created stack

## Task 2: Verify Mushop Application Resources Deployment.

1. Go to `Home > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks` and click on the newly created stack and make sure its state is Active.
   ![mushop_stack_state_info](.//images/mushop-stack-state-info.png)
2. Click on the newly created mushop stack

4. Load Balancer Details : `Hamburger > Networking > Load Balancers`.

5. Compute Node :

## Task 3: Delete Mushop Application  

With the use of Terraform, the Resource Manager stack is also responsible for terminating the application.

Follow these steps to completely remove all provisioned resources:

1. Return to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console and go to `Home > Developer Services > Resource Manager > Stacks`. Select the Mushop Stack.
2. From the Stack Details, select Terraform Actions > Destroy
    ![mushop_delete_stack](.//images/mushop-delete-stack.png)
3. Confirm the Destroy job when prompted
    ![mushop_destroy_confirm](.//images/mushop-destroy-confirm.png)
4. The job status will be In Progress while resources are terminated. 
    ![mushop_destroy_in_progress](.//images/mushop-destroy-in-progress.png)
    ![mushop_destroy_in_progress_check](.//images/mushop-destroy-in-progress-check.png)
5. Once the destroy job has succeeded, return to the Stack Details page and Click Delete Stack and confirm when prompted
    ![mushop_destroy_complete](.//images/mushop-destroy-complete.png)
    ![mushop_stack_delete](.//images/mushop-stack-delete.png)
    ![mushop_stack_delete_confirm](.//images/mushop-stack-delete-confirm.png)


## Task 4: Delete OELZ Stack 

To delete entire OELZ stack, there are a few resources that will require some manual intervention due to dependancies or conditions that are outside of Terraform's knowledge. 

The steps to clean up these resources is as follows: 

1. Bucket Removal
    - Navigate to the audit bucket, default bucket, and service event bucket in the logging compartment, and archive bucket in the home compartment.
    - For each bucket:
        - Delete the retention rules: on the bucket page, navigate to Resource → Retention Rules.
        - Delete all the objects in the bucket: on the bucket page, navigate to Resource → Objects.
        - Delete the bucket.

2. Identity Domain
    - Deactivate the identity domain created in the security compartment for each env: on the Identity Domain page, navigate to More actions → Deactivate.
    - Delete the identity domain. 

3. Vault/Key
    - The vault cannot be deleted right away. Vaults have a minimum 7-Day waiting period before deletion. This is because once the Vault is deleted, all    data encrypted with keys in that Vault becomes unreadable. 
    * You can move the vault and the Master Encryption Key to another compartment outside the Enterprise Scale Baseline Landing Zone home before deleting it in order to delete the landing zone.
    * Or you can schedule a deletion for the key and the vault, and then wait to delete the Enterprise Scale Baseline Landing Zone when the Vault and key have been deleted. 

4. Delete the stack.

## Task 5: Known Issue 

1. In case of quota/service limit/permission issues, Apply job will fail and partial resources will be provisioned. Click on Destroy button will trigger the job to remove provisioned resources.
2. Sometimes DB provisioning is not allowed in the tenanacy , in this case Job will fail. Click on Destroy button will trigger the job to remove provisioned resources.
