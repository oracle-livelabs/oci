# Workshop Overview

## About this Workshop - Deploying Reference Architectures on OCI

This session on "Deploying Reference Architectures on OCI" will showcase how to create a 3-tier application in the OCI console using Resource Manger and a reference architecture from the Oracle Architecture Center. We will look at the initial architecture and discuss how we can improve the design for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR), while also incorporating a real customer use case. Throughout the presentation and demonstration, we will discuss common anti-patterns and how they compare to OCI Best Practices to guide our application deployment process. Lastly, we will look at other reference architectures and solution playbooks so that you will be able to explore further use cases and deploy them on your own after the session.

### **Duration: 2 Hours**

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Explain the layers of a 3-tier architecture and how you can improve it for HA and DR
* Demonstrate how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure helps you quickly deploy example architectures within the console
* Discuss best practices and how they compare to anti-patterns
