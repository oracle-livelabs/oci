# Workshop Overview

## About this Workshop - OCI Networking and Security Quick Start

This session on OCI Tutorial - OCI Networking and Security Quick Start will discuss how security is built into each area of your Oracle Cloud environment and provide overviews of several key services you can leverage to secure your Oracle Cloud Workloads. We will cover Oracle's security principles, how Identity & Access Management (IAM) is used throughout your tenancy, as well as security features within networking.
