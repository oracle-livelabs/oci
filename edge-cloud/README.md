# Enable Gen AI from Cloud to the Edge with OCI Edge Cloud

## Introduction


Get hands-on learning with training labs about Oracle Edge cloud solutions. The workshops featured cover various solutions, skill levels, and categories based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)and Oracle Edge Cloud Solutions like Compute Cloud@Customer and Roving Edge Device.

## What is Oracle Distributed Cloud?

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) is the fastest growing cloud in the world, with over 48+ cloud regions across the globe enabling customers to rapidly onboard, deploy and scale their workloads. While the adoption of the public cloud is steadily increasing, organizations around the globe are also actively looking for distributed hybrid cloud solutions that offer them flexibility, scalability while also being able to meet strict data residency and latency requirements.  

Oracle offers the best core-to-edge cloud portfolio with distributed cloud offerings spanning the public cloud, Cloud@Customer and Edge with identical development, deployment and consumption methodologies. 


## Oracle Edge Cloud – Consume OCI services anywhere

Oracle’s Edge Cloud delivers the same OCI IaaS – compute, storage and networking capabilities at both air-gapped and connected locations – in a customer’s datacenter or at the edge. Oracle Edge Cloud offers customers the flexibility to scale from single node deployments using the Roving Edge Device and get up to 6600+ cores with the Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer. Oracle Edge Cloud also enables customers to develop applications once and deploy either in the public cloud, on-premises in their datacenter or at the edge – all while benefitting from cloud economics, ease of management and control over data residency and security.

### Edge Cloud Deployment Scenarios

With Oracle Edge Cloud, customers can consume OCI IaaS services - right up to the edge while also having the options to be connected, disconnected or intemittently connected to the Oracle cloud region. Here is a sample mesh deployment scenario with Oracle Roving Edge Device and Compute Cloud@Customer being tethered to their home Oracle Cloud regions.
