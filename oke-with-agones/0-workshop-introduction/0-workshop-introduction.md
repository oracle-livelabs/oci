# Introduction

## **What is OKE and Agones?**

### OKE Intro

Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) is the runtime within OCI for the running and operations of enterprise-grade Kubernetes at scale. You can easily deploy and manage resource-intensive workloads such as dedicated game servers with automatic scaling, patching, and upgrades.

### Agones Intro

Agones is an open source platform, for deploying, hosting, scaling, and orchestrating dedicated game servers for large scale multiplayer games, built on top of the industry standard, distributed system platform Kubernetes.

Agones replaces bespoke or proprietary cluster management and game server scaling solutions with an open source solution that can be utilized and communally developed - so that you can focus on the important aspects of building a multiplayer game, rather than developing the infrastructure to support it.

### Workshop Lab Objectives

* Ensure you have installed the prerequisites
* Create the OCI infrastructure
* Setup OKE Autoscaling
* Setup Agones system pods with Helm
* Deploy an Agones Fleet (dedicated game servers)
* Scale a Agones Fleet and OKE nodes
* Teardown
