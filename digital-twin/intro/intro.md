# Get Started with Digital Twin on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

## About this Workshop

Companies define digital twin based on their business models. In this livelab, we define digital twin is used to detect anomaly of a machinery in the running process. To detect anomaly requires some form of a mathematical model that simulates the physical behavior of the system. 
The simulation models have been used to identify possible root causes of anomalies on standalone PCs for long time. Cloud technologies have enabled massive amounts of simulations to run on the server. Combing with other cloud technologies and MapleSim models, this hands-on lab introduce the reference architecture to massibly deploy simulation models into OCI as digital twin to generate the training data and identity the root causes of assets.

In this workshop, we use a telehandler simulation model to mimic the real telehandler. We generate training data from the simulation model. 

Then, we run the simulation models as the data source and change its parameter to mimic the running condition change. The OCI anomaly detection service will detect the anomaly events happened in the digital twin and send notification to operator for diagnosis. Further, we can use the diagnostic result to modify the control parameter to compensate the behavior of the asset.

**Livelab Architecture**:

As we don't have the real devices in the livelab, we use the same simulation model to generate the training signals and also generate anomaly by adjusting the simuluation parameters.
