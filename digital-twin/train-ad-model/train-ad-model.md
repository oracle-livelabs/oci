# Train Anomaly Detection Model

## Introduction
In this session, we will show you how to train an anomaly detection model using the synthetic signal data.

Anomaly Detection is the identification of rare items, events, or observations in data that differ significantly from the expectation. This can be used for several scenarios like asset monitoring, maintenance and prognostic surveillance in industries such as utility, aviation, transportation, and manufacturing.

The core algorithm of our Anomaly Detection service is an Oracle-patented multivariate time-series anomaly detection algorithm originally developed by Oracle Labs and had been successfully used in several industries for prognosis analysis.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Anomaly Detection will create customized Machine Learning models by taking the data uploaded by users, using the core algorithm to train the model, and hosted in the cloud to be ready for detection. Users can then send new data to the detection endpoints to get detected anomaly results.

*Estimated Time*: 30 minutes

### Objectives
