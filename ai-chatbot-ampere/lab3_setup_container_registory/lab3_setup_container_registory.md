# Create OCIR repository with chat-bot image in OCI

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry is an Oracle-managed registry that enables you to simplify your development to production workflow. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry makes it easy for you as a developer to store, share, and manage development artifacts like Docker images. And the highly available and scalable architecture of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ensures you can reliably deploy your applications.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

## Task 1: Create Auth token and a OCIR repository

1. Sign into your OCI console and click the user icon (top right)  then **My Profile**. Under Resources Click **Auth Token**, then **Generate Token**. In pop up window provide a description then Click **Generate Token**

2.  Click **Copy** and save the token in Notepad. **Do not close the window without saving the token as it can not be retrieved later**

3. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Developer Services**, and select **Container Registry**.

4. Click **Create Repository**. Provide Repository name (all Lowercase), Check **Public** for **Access**, Click **Create Repository**

5. Once created, verify there are no existing images in the repository. Note down the **User** and **namespace**, we will use them in the next step.


*We now have a repository and Auth token (to validate login to the registry). Next we will use Cloud Shell to push and pull images from this registry.*

## Task 2: Push an open-source image to registry

1. SSH into your compute instance created earlier. 

2. We will now pull serge-ai opensource image from Docker registry to the compute instance. Enter Command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker pull ghcr.io/amperecomputingai/ampere-ai-serge-chat:0.0.7
    </copy>
    ```
    Verify image pull was successful, Enter Command
    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and verify image is present with the tag

     ![](images/docker_pull.png " ")

3. Push this image to repository created in OCI. First login to Registry in OCI. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker login <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io
    </copy>
    ```

    **NOTE:** Region name code are, fra for Frankfurt, iad for Ashburn, lhr for London, phx for Phoenix.

    **HINT:** Your region is shown on top right corner of OCI console window

4. Provide the information:

    - Username:  Enter it in format Namespace/User (for example: TS-SPL-55/email_id@oracle.com)
    - Password: Paste the Auth key copied earlier (Characters wont be visible)

    **NOTE:** Namespace and User values are the same that we noted in **Task 1 - Step 5**.

5. Verify Login Succeeded message is displayed.

6. Next we will tag the image that we pulled from the web. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and note down the image id of serge-ai-chat. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker tag <image_id>  <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<namespace>/<repository_name>:latest
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](images/docker_tag.png " ")

    **Note**: Here **latest** is the tag for the image. Tagging an image with **latest** makes sure the latest version is pulled when there are multiple images present with different tags.

7. Verify the tag was created, Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker images
    </copy>
    ```
    and verify new image is present with **latest** tag.

    **NOTE:** Tagging an image with **latest** makes sure the latest version is pulled when there are multiple images present with different tags.

     ![](images/docker_images.png " ")

8. We will now push the image to docker registry in OCI. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker push <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<Tenancy_Name>/<docker_registry_name>:latest
    </copy>
    ```
    ![](images/docker_push.png " ")

9. Switch to OCI web console and navigate to your registry. Newly pushed image should be visible.

    **HINT:** Refresh the browser window if image is not displayed

10. Switch to compute instance ssh window. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    docker pull <Region_Name_Code>.ocir.io/<Tenancy_Name>/<docker_registry_name>:latest
    </copy>  
    ```

11. Verify the pull command was successful

     ![](images/docker_pull_2.png " ")

    **HINT:** We are pulling the same image that we just pushed.<br/>
    *We now have a working repository and can successfully push and pull images to/from it.*

## Task 3: Delete the resources(Optional)

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will
appear.

3. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Terminate All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted

     ![](images/delete_vcn.png " ")

4. Navigate to your registry (**Container Registry** under **Developer Services**), Click Registry Name, Under **Actions** Click **Delete Repository**, Click **Delete** in confirmation window.
