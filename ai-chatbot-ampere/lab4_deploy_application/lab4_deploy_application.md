# Deploy and expose chatbot app

## Introduction

In this lab we will deploy the opensource chat-bot image from OCIR and expose it on a public URL to use it via the internet.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

## Task 1: Deploy chatbot app using minikube

1. SSH into your compute instance if not already in, Enter command:
    ```
    <copy>cd ~/path_to_saved_ssh_directory</copy>
    ```
    ```
    <copy>ssh -i <private_sshkeyname> opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE></copy>
    ``` 

2.  Start minikube on the ports opened earlier which are 80, 443, 8008:
    ```
    <copy>
    minikube start --listen-address='0.0.0.0' --ports=80,443,8008
    </copy>
    ``` 
    ![](./images/minikube_start.png " ")

    Verify that minikube is running:
    ```
    <copy>
    minikube status
    </copy>
    ``` 
    ![](./images/minikube_status.png " ")
     
3. Create a new namespace named **serge-ai** for the application deployment:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl create namespace serge-ai
    </copy>
    ``` 
    The command returns **namespace/serge-ai created**.

4. Set Kubernetes context to the new namespace created on above step:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=serge-ai
    </copy>
    ```

5. Download the sample YAML file into the compute instance:
    ```
    <copy>
    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/xYj5NQPsTNTpAymaMqmIewWBUuJT2csonULFAYTDHKx1Qfk1XbTTBtgjY1ltWKPP/n/idpyvi2wwmdw/b/yaml_file_storage/o/serge_ai_minikube.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    ![](./images/wget.png " ")

    Update the image source in the YAML file:
    ```
    <copy>
    nano serge_ai_minikube.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
    Update the below shown line, add your **region key, namespace and OCIR repository name** created in **Lab 1**.

    ![](./images/nano.png " ")

    Save the file by pressing **control + x and then y**.

6. Apply the Kubernetes YAML file saved in the step above, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f serge_ai_minikube.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
    Verify that the deployment is running:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl get svc
    </copy>
    ```
    Notice that there is no external IP exposed(status **Pending**) for accessing the application.

    ![](./images/lab4_task1_6.png)

7. Run the minikube tunnel to create an external IP for this deployment:
     ```
    <copy>
    minikube tunnel > /dev/null &
    </copy>
    ```    
    Verify the external IP is exposed for the deployment:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl get svc
    </copy>
    ```
    ![](./images/get_svc.png " ")

    **Note**: Here, the commands *```&```* and **> /dev/null** makes sure the output of **minikube** is hidden and it runs in the background.

8. To expose this deployment to the external world, we need to forward it to the open ports on our VCN:
     ```
    <copy>
    kubectl relay --address 0.0.0.0 --server.namespace=serge-ai svc/serge 5005:8008 2>/dev/null &
    </copy>
    ```
    **Note**: Here commands *```&```* and **2>/dev/null** makes sure the output of **kubectl** command is hidden and it runs in the background.

9. Now access the application on your browser, open a browser window and enter following URL:
    ```
    <copy>
    http://<compute_instance_public_ip>:5005
    </copy>
    ```
    Copy the **```compute_instance_public_ip```** from OCI web console. Open **instances** from the top left corner and click on instance created in **Lab 1** to copy the **public ip address**.

    **Note**: Using an incognito browser window helps not saving cache.

    ![](./images/chatbot-run-1.png " ")

## Troubleshooting(Optional)
If the application is not up and running on the browser, it can be one of the following issues:
1. Subnet in VCN is not allowing ingress traffic - <br/>
    To check this, follow Lab 1 Steps 7 to 10 and verify following ports to be open:

    ![](images/ingress_ports.png " ")

2. Due to inactivity the SSH connection may break and you might get an error **```opc@a1-instance:/$ client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe```**, SSH back into the instance again in that case. Enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    minikube status
    </copy>
    ```
    If minikube has stopped then restart it using:
    ```
    <copy>
    minikube start --listen-address='0.0.0.0' --ports=80,443,8008
    </copy>
    ``` 
    Check your deployment again, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl get svc
    </copy>
    ```
    Enable port forwarding again, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    kubectl relay --address 0.0.0.0 --server.namespace=serge-ai svc/serge 5005:8008 2>/dev/null &
    </copy>
    ```
    Re-access the application on your browser, open a browser window and enter following URL:
    ```
    <copy>
    http://<compute_instance_public_ip>:5005
    </copy>
    ```
    Copy the **```compute_instance_public_ip```** from OCI web console. Open **instances** from the top left corner and click on instance created in **Lab 1** to copy the **public ip address**.

3. Linux is blocking traffic, check iptable has correct ports allowed:
    ```
    <copy>
    sudo iptables -L
    </copy>
    ```
    ![](images/ingress_ports.png " ")

## Task 2: Automating the deployment
Now that all the steps have been completed and you application is running, we will be automating the process. We will be creating a script with all the steps used to deploy the application to that will run the app on reboot and exit. 

1. SSH into the compute instance and in main directory, create a file named `start-app.sh` 

    ```
    <copy>
    nano start-app.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    within this code, you'll paste the following commands created above:

    ```
    <copy>
    #!/bin/bash -x
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/home/opc/.krew/bin
    config_device()
    {
        BASE_DIR=/home/opc
        KUBE_PORTS="80,443,8008"
        KUBE_ADDR="0.0.0.0"
        PORT_EXPOSED=5005
        LOGFILE=${BASE_DIR}/serge-ai.log
    }

    init_actions()
    {
        # Start Minikube
        /usr/local/bin/minikube start --listen-address=${KUBE_ADDR} --ports=${KUBE_PORTS} 1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1
        # Create Kubernetes namespace
        /usr/local/bin/kubectl create namespace serge-ai  1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1
        # Set Kubernetes context to the new namespace
        /usr/local/bin/kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=serge-ai  1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1
        # Start Minikube tunnel in the background
        /usr/local/bin/kubectl apply -f $BASE_DIR/serge_ai_minikube.yaml  1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1
        /usr/local/bin/minikube tunnel 1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1 &
        # Forward port for the Serge deployment in the background
        /usr/local/bin/kubectl relay --address ${KUBE_ADDR} --server.namespace=serge-ai svc/serge ${PORT_EXPOSED}:8008 1>>$LOGFILE 2>&1 &
    }
    config_device
    init_actions

    </copy>
    ```

    Save the script by pressing **control + x** and then **y**.
    
    Make the script executable, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    chmod +x start-app.sh
    </copy>
    ```
    Give write permissions to the script.
    ```
    <copy>
    chmod u+w start-app.sh
    </copy>
    ```
    Execute the script, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    ./start-app.sh
    </copy>
    ```
   Give 2-3 minutes for the script to execute and deployment to run.

   **Note**: This script re-runs all the deployment commands listed above and is an convinent way to do a quick deployment.


2. In order to make our deployment reboot and crash proof run a cronjob which will run the above script on every reboot. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    crontab -e
    </copy>
    ```
    Press **i** to insert and type the following code.
    ```
    <copy>
    @reboot /home/opc/start-app.sh
    </copy>
    ```
    Save and exit your code editor by pressing ```<esc_key>``` then typing ```:wq``` and hit enter.

    Now the deployment script runs on each reboot and exit, making our application crash proof.

3. Reboot the system to test the cronjob. Enter the command: 
    ```
    <copy>
    sudo reboot
    </copy>
    ```
    
    **Note**: Wait about 2 - 5 mins after running the script to make sure the application is up and running.

4. Re-access the application on your browser, open a browser windown and enter following URL:
    ```
    <copy>
    http://<compute_instance_public_ip>:5005
    </copy>
    ```
    Copy the **```compute_instance_public_ip```** from OCI web console. Open **instances** from the top left corner and click on instance created in Lab 1 to copy the **public ip address**.

    **Note**: Using an incognito browser window helps not saving cache.

    ![](./images/chatbot-run-1.png " ")

## Task 3: Delete the resources(Optional)

1. To stop minikube and remove deployment, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>
    minikube stop --all
    </copy>
    ```
