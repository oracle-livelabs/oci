## About this AI Experience

A sales VP led his team of three dedicated sales associates on a cross-country trip to meet with a mid-sized fitness company in Chicago, where they aimed to pitch customized commercial loan packages to fuel the client's expansion plans. After thorough preparation, the team arrived at the client's headquarters for the on-site meeting, demonstrating how the loans could optimize cash flow. With the meeting being a success, and receiving a verbal commitment, the VP now leverages Oracle’s embedded AI tools to efficiently tackle any post meeting action items. By utilizing these tools, he ensures the deal progresses seamlessly and all items are finished effortlessly.
