# Provisioning Media Services using Terraform

## Introduction

This lab will use the OCI command line tool Media Services APIs to transcode, stream the video.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objective 

In this lab, you will

* Deploy terraform sample code that will create required Media Workflow and Media Streams components
* Run Media workflow Job on Terraform provisioned resource.
* Playback the video with Safari or VLC or other HLS players.


### Prerequisites
-  Familiarity with Media Flow and Media Streams using OCI Console
- Working knowledge of terraform

## Task 1: Deployment Steps

1. Update the [variable](tf-json/variables.tf) file with required information for the terraform execution.
2. Make sure you have the latest terraform. These were executed in the below environment:

   ```
    <copy>Terraform v1.3.1
    provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/oci v4.98.0</copy>
   ```
## Task 2: Download required JSON and validate.

1. Download the files (both \*.tf and JSON/\*.json) 
   [JSON1](tf-json/JSON/getfiles.json)
   [JSON2](tf-json/JSON/mediaflow.json)
   [JSON3](tf-json/JSON/putfiles.json)
   [JSON4](tf-json/JSON/thumbnails.json)
   [JSON5](tf-json/JSON/transcode.json)
   [JSON6](tf-json/JSON/transcribe.json)
   [JSON7](tf-json/JSON/visiondetection.json)
   [TF1](tf-json/data.tf)
   [TF2](tf-json/identity.tf)
   [TF3](tf-json/main.tf)
   [TF4](tf-json/mediastream.tf)
   [TF5](tf-json/mediaworkflow.tf)
   [TF6](tf-json/objectstorage.tf)
   [TF7](tf-json/provider.tf)

2. Initiate the Terraform

   ```
    <copy>$ terraform init</copy>
   ```
3. Validate the content
   ```
   <copy>$ terraform validate</copy>
   ``` 

## Task 3: Plan and Apply the configuration.

1. Make sure the Plan works with no errors.
   ```
   <copy>$ terraform plan</copy>
   ```
2. Apply the Terraform 
   ```
   <copy>$ terraform apply</copy>
   ``` 
## Task 4: Upload the video to the object storage bucket.

1. After you apply, the output should get you the direct URL to upload the video file.
   ```
   <copy>Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    comment = "You can either use the PAR URL to upload your content directly or use OCI Console to upload the video object"
    media_workflow_id = "ocid1.mediaworkflow.oc1.phx.yourworkflowid"
    upload_objects_to = "https://console.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/object-storage/buckets/yournamespace/Demo_source/objects"
    using_par_document_reference = "https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm"</copy>
   ```
2. Upload your video to the bucket

## Task 5: Run Media Workflow Job and Playback your video.
    
3.  Navigate to the console & Run the Media Workflow Job.
    ![Run job from console](images/run_job_console.png " ")
4.  Select the video that you uploaded and submit job.
    ![Select video and submit job](images/select_video_submit_job.png " ")
5.  Once the Job is complete, you can navigate to the Distribution Channel and gather the preview URL for playback.
