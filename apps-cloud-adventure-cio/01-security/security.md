### Objectives

## Task 1: Use Oracle Global Order Promising to determine most profitable to promise and on-time delivery options to satisfy customers' needs.  

1. You have recently entered a new Sales Order for which manual scheduling is required.   Let’s review our options and ensure that GOP has selected the most cost-effective option.

    > Click on the **Order Management** tab and select **Manage Orders** from the Quick Actions List.

    > Enter order number **98431** in the order field and click **Search.**   Order 98431 will appear in the **Search Results.**

4. All information regarding a Sales Order can be accessed via this screen, including its current state, and all fulfillment details.

    > Click on **Actions**, and then **Switch to Fulfillment View.**

5. The Fulfillment View provides all the relevant details for each line such as inventory details, promising dates, scheduling details, and shipping parameters. Real-time availability checking and order scheduling allows users to quickly investigate delivery exceptions.  

    > Click on **Check Availability**.

6. The Availability Status indicates the sales order will be delivered on-time!  Oracle Cloud Global Order Promising has found sufficient supply to fulfill the order.

    > Review the details and other available options by clicking on **View Availability Options**.

7. The Availability Options shows multiple options based on different shipping methods. However, Oracle Cloud Global Order Promising using Profitable to Promise considered the default option with lowest fulfillment cost. 

    > **Review the options, and record the cost, shipping date, and shipping method for the most profitable selection.**

8. Availability Details will give you a full view into the specifics of the fulfillment process, including all purchases, manufacturing, and transfers that are required.

    > Select the **Current Option** row under Availability Option, click on **Actions**, and then select **Availability Details**.

9. The Availability Details pegging information helps Natalie understand how the order can be promised on time. In this example, Global Order Promising reviewed the profitable supply chain network to promise the order. 

    > Note that item **ECM37004** was sourced from Liberty Electric, which is not the primary source of the item, but a secondary lest costly option GOP identified based on using Profitable to Promise.  

    .
    > GOP can be configured to consider several variables when considering profitability.

## Summary

Order Promising is a critical supply chain process that drives major costs and customer service levels. Every company’s reputation rests on their ability to provide the highest levels of customer service, while their financial viability depends on their ability to determine both reliable and profitable order fulfillment. 

In this example, we used Oracle Global Order Promising’s robust profitable to promise capabilities to commit to Steel Fitness’ request with confidence and successfully fulfill our customer’s needs with the lowest cost available.  

**You have successfully completed the Activity!**
