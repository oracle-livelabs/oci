## Task 1: Guided Journeys with User Defined Content

Guided Journeys allow you to configure business processes to support user tasks by providing guidance, such as additional information, tutorials, company policies, best practices and more. The User Defined Content feature of a Guided Journey Task allows users to define guided journey tasks and connect to a user defined REST API. The user defined REST API can retrieve data from external sources based on the context information passed from the calling user interface.

As a Pit Crew member and the Oracle SaaS Business Process and Configuration expert for your organization, you’re up to the task.

**Objectives**<br>
In this activity you will use a Guided Journey Task with USer Defined Content and  and Visual Builder Studio.  You will:

   &emsp;  • Link the Guided Journey Task with User Defined Content with a pre-configured Generative AI endpoint <br>
   &emsp;  • Configure Self Service Procurement Shopping Cart to include the configured Checklist Template <br>
   &emsp;  • Preview your changes to see how you can now access real-time reviews from your cart.

As you follow along, do not forget to answer the Adventure Check Point questions! 

1. The first step to creating our Guided Journey is to setup a Checklist Template, which defines the tasks related to our Guided Journey.

    > (1) Enter **Checklist Templates** in the search field at the top of the home page.  <br>    
    > (2) Select **Checklist Templates** from the resulting dropdown search results.

2. The first step is to configure a Checklist Template to include the Guided Journey Task. We’ve already setup Checklist Templates for each Cloud Adventure User, so you'll start by searching for your specific template.

    > (1) Enter **CA&#95;##** in the **search** field, **where ## is your assigned user number**. <br>

<br>

17. You will now use the embedded Visual Builder Studio tool to configure this page. The configuration will allow you to reference your previously defined Guided Journey and Task. Visual Builder is the tool that Oracle uses to develop Fusion Cloud Application screens.  Customers can use these same tools to perform configurations or, as we saw in other adventures, create new screens using the same look and feel as the delivered applications.


   > (1) Click the **User Photo/User ID icon** on the top right corner of the screen. <br>    
   > (2) Select **Edit Page in Visual Builder Studio** from the resulting dropdown list.

   ![Create Task](images/image118.png)

19. You’re now in Visual Builder – Express Mode.  This allows you to easily configure application screens.  In this scenario, you’ll be referencing the Guided Journey/Task that you created earlier.

   > (1) Enter **Journey** in the **Page Properties Filter** field on the right.  This will narrow the list of Page Properties available. <br>    
   > (2) Enter **CA&#95;##** in the **Shopping Cart Guided Journey Code** field and press the **Enter** key.  Be careful to enter this into the correct field as there are several similar fields available.  If you searched as described in Step 1, it’s likely the 1st field listed below the filter.

   ![Create Task](images/image119.png)  
<br>

20. You will now see the Product Items Review graphic on the screen.  This was defined in the Category Template at the beginning of this adventure.  You will now test this by running the screen in Preview mode.

   > Click the **Preview** ![Preview](images/Icon06_preview.png) icon in the top right of the screen.

21. You are now back in Self-Service Procurement and you can see that your 2 items are in the cart.  So, you will now open your cart.

   > Click the **Cart** icon on the bottom of the screen. 

   ![Create Task](images/image121.png)  
<br>

22. The **Product Items Review** image is prominently displayed. Clicking it will call an external Gen AI Service to gather review information about the items in your cart.

   > Click the **Product Items Review** image. 

   ![Create Task](images/image122.png)  
<br>

23. The Guided Journey Task has called your User Defined Content integration.  As discussed in the introduction to this adventure, it calls Oracle Integration to gather additional prompt information, such as Position and New York, prior to our Generative AI call to the external LLM.  The results are then formatted and displayed as shown.

   > (1) When finished reviewing the result, you can close your browser tabs and exit the Oracle Cloud Application UI.
