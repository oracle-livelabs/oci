## **Task 1: Use REST API to pull Fusion SaaS Application audit data for use in any external system**


1. We’re going to login to Fusion Cloud ERP

    > Navigate to your Oracle Fusion Cloud Demo Environment Instance and sign in with the Username and Password provided

    ![Application login page](images/image001.png)

    ![Stop](images/stop.png)

    **Notice the Hybrid Login capabilities.** 

    **Today, we will be logging in with username and password, but most customers elect to use SSO. You can also have hybrid setup.**



2. Let’s navigate to the Suppliers work area to modify a supplier’s address information

    > Click the **Procurement** tab

    ![Application Homepage](images/image002.png)

    > Click the **Show More** button

    ![Procurement View](images/image003.png)

    > Click the **Manage Suppliers** button

    ![Show More View](images/image004.png)


3. Next, we’re going to search for the Supplier you’ve been assigned, e.g. “01…”

    > Click in the **Keywords** search bar

    ![Manage Suppliers View](images/image005.png)  

    > (1) **Search** for a supplier using the user id number (e.g. 01, 02).  <br>

    > (2) Click the **Search** button

    ![Keywords search bar](images/image006.png)  

    > Click the **Edit** ![Edit Icon](images/icon01_edit.png)  button in the ‘Search Results’ area

    > Click the **Addresses** tab

    ![Suppliers View](images/image008.png)  

    > Click the **Edit** ![Edit Icon](images/icon01_edit.png) icon to edit the Supplier’s address

    ![Edit Suppliers View](images/image009.png)  


5.   **Note:** We’ll only edit the Supplier’s second line of address information, i.e. ‘Address Line 2’ text entry field. 

    We’re going to add a Suite (e.g. 123) to the Supplier’s address information that was missing before.

    > Click in the **Address Line 2** text entry field 

    ![Edit Suppliers View](images/image010.png)

    > Type new address information into **Address Line 2**, e.g. ‘Suite 123’

    > Click **Save and Close** 

    ![Edit Suppliers View](images/image012.png)

    > Click **Submit** 

    ![Edit Suppliers View](images/image013.png)

6.  **Note:** We’ve modified our demo environment’s approval workflow for internal supplier profile changes to be automatically approved for            demonstration purposes, however this can be configured based on each customer’s business requirements

    > Click **OK** on the resulting confirmation box. 

    ![Suppliers View](images/image014.png)

    > Click **Done**

7. Let’s navigate back to the Oracle Fusion Cloud home screen.

    > Click the **Home** ![Home Icon](images/icon02_home.png) button

    ![Suppliers View](images/image016.png)



8. Now, we’re going to discover how we can audit several pieces of information that’s relevant to our cloud adventure today: user access (sign in / sign out) as well as supplier address information changes via REST API integrations.

    > At the home screen, Navigate to **Integration** tab

    ![Home](images/image017.png)

    > Click on **Audit Report REST Endpoints**

    ![Integrations View](images/image018.png)
    
    ![Stop](images/stop.png)

    **This is an example of a configuration. This tile links out to an external website.**

    **Take note of the detailed documentation. API endpoints, parameters, code examples, use cases, Oracle’s documentation is public and designed to be very useful.**


9. Let’s review the REST API endpoints that we can use to review Auditable data that can be extracted from Fusion Cloud.

    ![Audit Report REST Endpoints](images/image019.png)

    > Click on **Get an audit report** under **Audit Report**

    ![Audit Report REST Endpoints](images/image020.png)

## Summary

Throughout the Cloud Adventure for the office of the CIO, Integration activity guide, students are immersed in an interactive and engaging 
journey into the world of Fusion Cloud's REST API integration features. The primary goal of this instructional adventure was to empower 
students with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively audit both user sign on activity as well as supplier address changes in Fusion 
Cloud Supply Chain Management (SCM). Throughout this exploration, they uncovered the potential of Fusion Cloud's integration tools, 
enhancing their understanding of supply chain security management integration and auditing processes.

Within the activity, students embarked on a hands-on exploration, beginning with a login to the Fusion Cloud SCM system. They navigated with 
purpose to the Suppliers work area, where they were tasked with modifying a supplier's address information. This interactive modification set 
the stage for the upcoming auditing activities. Cloud adventurers then delved into the Integration tab, a powerhouse of auditing capabilities 
within the Fusion Cloud platform. Here, they uncovered the 'Audit Report REST Endpoints,' a revelation of the potential to extract valuable 
auditable data. With growing curiosity, they scrutinized example request payloads and response bodies, gaining insights into the structure and 
content of auditing information.

The journey of Fusion Cloud integration exploration continued as students applied their newfound knowledge. They returned to the familiar 
grounds of the Fusion Cloud and audited the supplier address change they had made earlier. This practical application of REST API integration 
theory added a layer of depth to their practical understanding. As the adventure continued, the students ventured into the captivating world of 
Oracle APEX application integration, which simulated a 3rd party auditing application for the purposes of this cloud adventure. They skillfully 
authenticated their integration APEX application, utilizing the provided cloud adventure environment instance and password.

With the connection established, adventurers delved deeper, exploring the ‘Sign-on’ Audit area, where they uncovered a treasure trove of user 
access details. They reviewed the corresponding REST API, gaining insights into the security and transparency of user access history. The journey 
then led them to the 'Audit History' section, a comprehensive record of supplier address changes. Here, they extracted historical data, 
witnessing firsthand the power of Fusion Cloud to meticulously track and record business object data modifications. By scrutinizing the demo 
flow and API details, students developed a profound understanding of the platform's capabilities and their newfound auditing skills.

Throughout this immersive adventure, students not only acquired technical proficiency but also cultivated a deep appreciation for the potential 
of Fusion Cloud's REST API integration. They learned to navigate the intricate web of supply chain management integration, including how to 
audit user sign in activity, supplier address changes, and how to extract critical auditable information. With each step, they transformed from 
curious cloud adventurers to seasoned Fusion Cloud auditors, equipped with the knowledge and confidence to continue their Fusion Cloud
