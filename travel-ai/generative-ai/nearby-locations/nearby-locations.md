# Locate Nearby Airports and Other UNESCO Sites

## Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Maps, and Geo-Spatial features to locate the nearest UNESCO sites and Airports based on your selected UNESCO site. we will also see how we can get the best accommodation nearby within budget.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes.  
  
### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
 
* Locate Nearest Airports and UNESCO Sites within a given distance. 

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* You have Completed **Get Started**  

## Task 1: Locate Nearest Airport
 
1. Nearest Airport to selected UNESCO Location with in the search radius.
 
    ![Near by Sites](images/near-by-1.png =30%x* " ")

2. SQL Query with Radio button group to Locate Nearest Airport

    ![Near by Sites](images/nearest.png " ")
 
    ```sql
    <copy> 
    SELECT APEX_ITEM.RADIOGROUP 
        (
            1,
            p_value => B.ID,
            p_display => B.NAME 
        ) Airports
    FROM   
            UNESCO_SITES A,
            ALL_AIRPORTS B
    WHERE 
            rownum <= 20 AND A.UNIQUE_NUMBER = :P9_SELPLACE AND type != 'heliport'
        AND SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE(
        GET_GEOMETRY(A.LONGITUDE, A.LATITUDE),
        B.GEOMETRY,
        'distance='||:P9_DISTANCE||' unit=mile') = 'TRUE'
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Locate Nearest UNESCO Site

1. Nearest UNESCO Site to selected UNESCO Location with in the search radius.

    ![Near by Sites](images/near-by-2.png =30%x* " ")

2. SQL Query with Radio button group to Locate UNESCO Site
 
    ```sql
    <copy> 
    SELECT APEX_ITEM.RADIOGROUP 
        (
            2,
            p_value => A.UNIQUE_NUMBER,
            p_display => A.NAME_EN 
        ) sites
    FROM
            unesco_sites A,
            unesco_sites B
    WHERE
            B.UNIQUE_NUMBER = :P9_SELPLACE AND rownum <= 20
            AND SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE(
            GET_GEOMETRY(A.LONGITUDE, A.LATITUDE),
            B.GEOMETRY,
            'distance='||:P9_DISTANCE||' unit=mile') = 'TRUE'
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Plot the Map

1. Plot the Map based on nearest UNESCO location.

    ![Near by Sites](images/near-by-filter.png " ")

2. SQL Query to Plot Map based on nearest UNESCO Site from the selected site.

    ![Near by Sites](images/map.png " ")

    ```sql
    <copy> 
    SELECT A.ID,
        A.CATEGORY,
        A.STATES_NAME_EN,
        A.REGION_EN,
        A.UNIQUE_NUMBER, 
        A.NAME_EN, 
        A.SHORT_DESCRIPTION_EN,
        A.GEOMETRY   
    FROM
        unesco_sites A,
        unesco_sites B
    WHERE
        B.UNIQUE_NUMBER = :P9_SELPLACE AND rownum <= 20
    AND SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE(
        GET_GEOMETRY(A.LONGITUDE, A.LATITUDE),
        B.GEOMETRY,
        'distance='||:P9_DISTANCE||' unit=mile') = 'TRUE'
    </copy>
    ```
  
    This concludes this lab and you can **proceed to the next lab**.
