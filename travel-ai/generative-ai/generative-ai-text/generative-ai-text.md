# Generative AI (Text)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to Generate AI Text using Cohere or OpenAI REST APIs and help Travelers answer their questions related to the UNESCO site or activities around that site or even about the City itself.

Estimated Lab Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Generate AI Text using Cohere REST APIs. 

### Prerequisites:

- Completed Previous Labs and have access to Oracle APEX application.
- Intermediate Knowledge of Oracle APEX and PL/SQL 

### [About Cohere](https://cohere.com/)

Cohere is the leading AI platform for enterprise. Its world-class AI is uniquely suited to the needs of business, unlocking unprecedented ease-of-use, accessibility, and data privacy. Cohere’s platform is cloud-agnostic, accessible through API as a managed service, and can be deployed on virtual private cloud (VPC) or even on-site to meet companies where their data is, offering the highest levels of flexibility and control. Founded by Google Brain alumni and a co-author of the seminal Transformer research paper, Cohere is on a mission to transform enterprises and their products with AI that unlocks a more intuitive way to generate, search, and summarize information than ever before..


### Transform your products with LLMs

It’s never been easier to add AI to your products. Cohere’s models power interactive chat features, generate text for product descriptions, blog posts, and articles, and capture the meaning of text for search, content moderation, and intent recognition.

Using Cohere’s powerful embeddings models, you can make your applications understand the meaning of text data at massive scale, unlocking powerful semantic search, classification, and rerank capabilities.

## Task 1: Sign up at Cohere

1. Sign up and Sign in and [generate AI API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys)  

2. Generate Cohere API Key and read API key [limitations](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/going-live)

## Task 2: Getting Response from Cohere

1. Review the request JSON, Call API end point at https://api.cohere.ai/v1/generate

    ```json
    <copy> 
        {  
            "model": "command",
            "prompt": "Your input text here",
            "max_tokens": 300,
            "temperature": 0.9,
            "k": 0,
            "stop_sequences": [],
            "return_likelihoods": "NONE"
    }   
    </copy>
    ```

2. Review the response JSON

    ```json
    <copy> 
        {
            "id": "2c5fd5d6-743c-4a52-****-*****",
            "generations": [
                {
                    "id": "46907fbb-1d86-40fc-ba70-806d658ee901",
                    "text": "\n your answer goes here  "
                }
            ],
            "prompt": "your question goes here",
            "meta": { "api_version": 
                        { 
                            "version": "1" 
                        } 
                    }
    }
    </copy>
    ```

3. PL/SQL Code to send request and get response back from Cohere, you can create an Oracle APEX Dynamic Region to display the results taking input from a page item after submitting the page. Construct PL/SQL Code block, Replace this code in the PL/SQL Dynamic content window, use [JSON_TABLE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/JSON_TABLE.html) to create a PL/SQL cursor

1. Response Dynamic PL/SQL block code

    ```sql
    <copy> 
        DECLARE
    
        l_url    VARCHAR2(4000) := 'https://api.cohere.ai/v1/generate';  
        l_input VARCHAR2(4000) := :P48_INPUT;
        
            l_body   VARCHAR2(4000) := '{
                "model": "command",
                "prompt": "'||l_input||'",
                "max_tokens": 300,
                "temperature": 0.9,
                "k": 0,
                "stop_sequences": [],
                "return_likelihoods": "NONE"
                }';
            l_response_json CLOB;
            l_text VARCHAR2(4000);

        CURSOR C1  IS 
            SELECT jt.* 
            FROM   JSON_TABLE(l_response_json, '$' 
                    COLUMNS (text VARCHAR2(2000)  PATH '$.generations[0].text' )) jt; 

        BEGIN

        if l_input is not null then

        apex_web_service.g_request_headers(1).name := 'Content-Type';
            apex_web_service.g_request_headers(1).value := 'application/json';
            apex_web_service.g_request_headers(2).name := 'Authorization';
            apex_web_service.g_request_headers(2).value := 'Bearer Your-cohere-API-Key';

        l_response_json := apex_web_service.make_rest_request( 
            p_url => l_url, 
            p_http_method => 'POST', 
            p_body => l_body  
        );

        --Htp.p(l_response_json ); 

            For row_1 In C1 Loop
                l_text := row_1.text;
                    Htp.p(  l_text );  
            End Loop;

            end if;

        END;     
    </copy>
    ```
 
## Task 3: Demo
