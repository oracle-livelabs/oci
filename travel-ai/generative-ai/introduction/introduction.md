# Introduction

### About this workshop 

Generative AI is an artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, image, audio and video.

Generative AI starts with a prompt, usually a text, audio message, or image, into an AI system that can process these inputs. Various AI algorithms then return new content in response to the prompt. Response content can be images, text essays, chat, solutions to problems, or realistic-looking fake photos created from the pictures or audio of a person or a video with AI-generated audio.  

Generative AI refers to deep-learning models that can take raw data from various data sources like Wikipedia or by crawling websites or social media channels, and it learns to generate outputs when prompted. For example, the AI model can be trained on a large quantity of data such as medical terminology, medical conditions, symptoms, patient records, etc. This will enable the AI algorithms to respond to the prompts of the content they have learned using natural language processing. 

In the Generative AI for Travel workshop, we use generative AI power to generate realistic 3D panoramic images to show various UNESCO heritage sites, talk about these places, what is nearby, the shopping experience, and the nearest accommodations the traveler can stay in. an AI travel guide is surely handy when exploring new places. 

The workshop extends the travel experience by providing details about the nearest airports, Airbnb accommodations, and the cheapest air tickets that one can buy to their chosen destination. A digital assistant chatbot can answer questions related to Visa documentation or passport-related queries in various regions.

Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours (Approximately)
