# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will use OCI OpenSearch Service v3.0 to build AI-driven, agentic workflows for observability and incident response. Learn to automate real-time telemetry ingestion with Data Prepper, interact with data through built-in AI and MCP agents, perform rapid root-cause analysis, and streamline incident resolution. Youâ€™ll leave with a working setup and best practices to transform cloud monitoring, cut mean time to resolution, accelerate development, and deliver actionable insights with advanced search and analytics.



Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
- Understand the prerequisites and prepare your tenancy for the creation of an OCI OpenSearch cluster
- Create an OCI Opensearch cluster
- Connect to your cluster by tunneling via OCI compute instance
- Explore the latest Opensearch Dashboard
- Ingest Sample data from Opensearch dashboard and perform data observability tasks
- Create KNN indices
- Register and deploy pretrained and remote models
- Create data Prepper pipeline
- Stream data into your opensearch index using data prepper pipeline.
- Configure AI Agent Tools
- Configure and Test various AI Agents
- Experiment with AI Agent Flow framework
- Enable Opensearch built-in  built in MCP Server
- Setup and Configure MCP desktop like Cline and connect to your opensearch MCP server
- Interact with your data conversationally to perform Root Cause Analysis and generate powerful observability insights.
