# Conclusion

In this workshop, you've learnt how to build a Micronaut application to publish standard and custom metrics to OCI Monitoring with the GDK, and to query and visualize the published metrics using the OCI Metrics Explorer.

You've seen how to use GraalVM Native Image to package and run the application as a native executable.

Application developers can use the Graal Development Kit for Micronaut (GDK) to build cloud-portable Java applications on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Micronaut and GraalVM Native Image.
