# Provision a Stream in Oracle Streaming Service with Kubernetes

## Introduction

You will use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Service Broker to manage the lifecycle of a stream, using Kubernetes.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes.

### Objectives

- Configure a stream instance and binding to deploy on kubernetes.
- Use kubectl to deploy the instance and provision the stream.
- Tear down the stream instance.

## Task 1: Get the Template Manifests for Streams

1. Download the example templates:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    mkdir -p streaming
    pushd streaming
    curl -o create-oss-instance.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-service-broker/master/charts/oci-service-broker/samples/oss/create-oss-instance.yaml
    curl -o create-oss-binding.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-service-broker/master/charts/oci-service-broker/samples/oss/create-oss-binding.yaml
    popd
    </copy>
    ```

2. How it works:

    - `create-oss-instance.yaml` defines a stream instance to be created in a specific compartment and optionally in a specific pre-created streaming pool.

    - `create-oss-binding.yaml` creates a binding to retrieve credentials providing access to the stream.

    - OCI Service Broker will then create a secret named `test-stream-binding` containing the access to the stream.


## Task 2: Edit the Manifests

1. Edit `create-oss-instance.yaml` and replace `CHANGE_COMPARTMENT_OCID_HERE` with the compartment OCID of the compartment where you deployed the OKE cluster, and the `CHANGE_PARTITION_COUNT_HERE` with the number of partitions you want (we'll use `1`).

    If you want to use a specific stream pool, uncomment the `streampoolId` value and provide a stream pool OCID.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    nano ./streaming/create-oss-instance.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    > **Note:** The stream name needs to be unique across the OCI compartment, even if you deploy on different Kubernetes namespaces.

    If you're running this as part of a workshop with multiple users, make sure you modify the name of the bucket to make it unique by replacing the name `teststream` with your unique name both in the `create-oss-instance.yaml` and `create-oss-binding.yaml` files.


## Task 3: Deploy

1. To deploy the mainfest use:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ./streaming
    </copy>
    ```

    This will deploy all the manifests in the `streaming` folder.

## Task 4: Check the Deployment

1. Verify the database instance is being provisioned:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get all
    </copy>
    ```

    Should list:

    ```
    NAME                                               CLASS                             PLAN       STATUS   AGE
    serviceinstance.servicecatalog.k8s.io/teststream   ClusterServiceClass/oss-service   standard   Ready    4m25s

    NAME                                                       SERVICE-INSTANCE   SECRET-NAME           STATUS   AGE
    servicebinding.servicecatalog.k8s.io/test-stream-binding   teststream         test-stream-binding   Ready    4m25s
    ```


2. Verify that the `test-stream-binding` secret with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get secrets
    </copy>
    ```

    Should list `test-stream-binding`

3. You can also check in the OCI console under **Solution and Platforms -> Analytics -> Streaming** in the compartment where you provisioned and you should see the stream named `teststream` (or the unique name you gave it).

## Task 5: Look at the Content of the Secret

1. You can view the content of the secret by running:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get secret test-stream-binding -o yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    It should return:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
    messageEndpoint: aHR0cHM6Ly9jZWxsLTEuc3RyZWFtaW5nLnVzLWFzaGJ1cm4tMS5vY2kub3JhY2xlY2xvdWQuY29t
    streamId: b2NpZDEuc3RyZWFtLm9jMS5pYWQuYW1hYWFhYWF4a2g1czZpYXVlZXdjMzcyczU3emJsc2UyeGJvbmxhaHczc28ycTU0YjdoNW50Y2hoempx
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2021-01-09T01:06:22Z"
    managedFields:
    - apiVersion: v1
        fieldsType: FieldsV1
        fieldsV1:
        f:data:
            .: {}
            f:messageEndpoint: {}
            f:streamId: {}
        f:metadata:
            f:ownerReferences:
            .: {}
            k:{"uid":"b26883f5-d6d5-48ac-bb01-9c4994f194dc"}:
                .: {}
                f:apiVersion: {}
                f:blockOwnerDeletion: {}
                f:controller: {}
                f:kind: {}
                f:name: {}
                f:uid: {}
        f:type: {}
        manager: service-catalog
        operation: Update
        time: "2021-01-09T01:06:22Z"
    name: test-stream-binding
    namespace: oci-service-broker
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
        blockOwnerDeletion: true
        controller: true
        kind: ServiceBinding
        name: test-stream-binding
        uid: b26883f5-d6d5...
    resourceVersion: "87133"
    selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/oci-service-broker/secrets/test-stream-binding
    uid: bac04231-91ee-4a02...
    type: Opaque
    ```

2. The content of the secret are the `messageEndpoint` and `streamId` fields, which are base64 encoded.

    When mounting the secret as a variable in a pod, this value will be decoded for you.

    To decode the content of the field, you can use:

    ```bash
    echo <field content> | base64 -d
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    echo aHR0cHM6Ly9jZWxsLTEuc3RyZWFtaW5nLnVzLWFzaGJ1cm4tMS5vY2kub3JhY2xlY2xvdWQuY29t | base64 -d
    ```

    Which returns:

    ```bash
    https://cell-1.streaming.us-ashburn-1.oci.oraclecloud.com
    ```

## Task 6: Usage

1. To mount the secret into a pod, use an environment variable like:

    ```yaml
    env:
    - name: STREAM_ID
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
            name: test-stream-binding
            key: streamId
    - name: STREAM_ENDPOINT
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
            name: test-stream-binding
            key: messageEndpoint
    ```

2. A full example deployment with the nginx image as base would be like:

    ```yaml
    <copy>
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: streaming-demo
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: streaming-demo
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: streaming-demo
        spec:
          containers:
          # User application that uses the PAR to access the bucket.
          - name: app
            image: nginx
            env:
            - name: STREAM_ID
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                    name: test-stream-binding
                    key: streamId
            - name: STREAM_ENDPOINT
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                    name: test-stream-binding
                    key: messageEndpoint
    </copy>
    ```

3. Create a new file `streaming-demo-app.yaml` and paste the content above.

4. Deploy the manifest with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl -apply -f streaming-demo-app.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

5. Verify the URI was properly defined by getting a shell into the pod.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods -n default
    </copy>
    ```

    Get the `streaming-demo` pod name then:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n default -- /bin/sh
    ```

    At the shell prompt inside the container, check the environment variables with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    env | grep STREAM
    </copy>
    ```

    Which should return something like:

    ```bash
    STREAM_ID=ocid1.stream.oc1.iad.amaaaaaaxkh5s6iad7v7ornyhgb7gtowg4x6hd3ru2g6ejtbonls426hnltq
    STREAM_ENDPOINT=https://cell-1.streaming.us-ashburn-1.oci.oraclecloud.com
    ```

6. Working with stream is beyond the scope of this workshop, so we'll leave it as an exercise to the reader.

    A few pointers:

    - In order to use streaming with a private stream pool with this stack, you will need to add a security list to allow communication with port 9092.
    - You can use the Kafka SDK to use the stream directly, however you will need to know the stream pool OCID to create the username, and you will need a user with an auth token and policy to use streams.
    - You can use the OCI SDK to connect to streams, in which case you need a user in a group with proper policies, and you need the public/private key pair for this user, as well as fingerprint to configure the OCI CLI in your container.

    Also:
    - Before tearing down the stack, you will need to remove the security list from the subnet for the subnet to be deprovisioned properly.

## Task 7: Clean Up

1. To undeploy, and terminate the stream instance, delete the Kubernetes instances:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl delete -f ./streaming
    </copy>
    ```
