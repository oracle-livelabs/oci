# Install Prerequisites

## Introduction

In this lab we will install the software required to run the stack to deploy an OKE cluster with OCI Service Broker.

Because the OCI Service Broker depends on Service Catalog, as well as the key value store etcd, all of which are deployed as Helm charts in Kubernetes. we need kubectl, as well as helm installed to run the stack. Furthermore the OCI CLI is used for some tasks and is required for kubectl.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Install the OCI CLI.
- Install kubectl >= 1.18.
- install Helm 3.x.
- Install Kustomize >= 1.19.
- Install Skaffold >= 1.18.

## Task 1: Install the OCI CLI

1. To install the OCI CLI on Linux or Mac OS X, run the command:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
    </copy>
    ```

    Press **Enter** to use the defaults for all options.

2. Restart your shell.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    exec -l $SHELL
    </copy>
    ```

3. Configure the OCI CLI.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    oci setup config
    </copy>
    ```

    You will be prompted for:
    - Location of the config. Press **Enter**.
    - `user_ocid`: enter your user OCID.
    - `tenancy_ocid`: enter your tenancy OCID.
    - `region`: enter your region from the list provided.
    - Generate a RSA key pair: press **Enter** for Yes (default).
    - Directory for keys: press **Enter** for the default.
    - name for the key: press **Enter** for the default.
    - Passphrase: press **Enter** for no passphrase.

    You should see an output like:

    ```bash
    Private key written to: /home/oracle/.oci/oci_api_key.pem
    Fingerprint: 21:d4:f1:a0:55:a5:c2:ce:e2:...
    Config written to ~/.oci/config
    ```

4. Upload the public key to your OCI account.

    In order to use the CLI, you need to upload the public key generated to your user account.

    Get the key content with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
    </copy>
    ```

    Or open the file with your prefered editor and copy the full printed output to clipboard.

    In the OCI web console:

    - Under **User -> User Settings**.
    - Click **API Keys**.
    - Click **Add Public Key**.
    - Click **Paste Public Key**.
    - Paste the key copied above.
    - Click **Add**.

    You can verify that the Fingerprint generated matches the fingerprint output of the config.

5. Test your CLI.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    oci os ns get
    </copy>
    ```

    This command should output the namespace of your tenancy (usually the name of the tenancy or a randomized string).

    ```json
    {
        "data": "your-tenancy-namespace"
    }
    ```

    Make a note of the name of your tenancy namespace for later.

## Task 2: Install `kubectl`

1. *If you are using Docker Desktop on Mac OS X or Windows, `kubectl` should already be installed, and you can skip the install step.*

2. To install `kubectl` run:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    PLATFORM=$(uname)
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/${PLATFORM,,}/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    </copy>
    ```

3. Make sure you have a recent version >= 1.18 with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl version --client
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 3: Install Helm

1. To install helm on Mac OS X and Linux, use:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
    </copy>
    ```

    For more detailed instructions for your specific OS, go to:
    [https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Task 4: Install Kustomize

1. To install Kustomize on Mac OS X and Linux, use:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh"  | bash
    </copy>
    ```

    For more detailed instructions for your specific OS, go to:
    [https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries/](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries/).

## Task 5: Install Skaffold

1. To install Skaffold on Mac OS X and Linux, use:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    PLATFORM=$(uname)
    curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-${PLATFORM,,}-amd64 && \
    sudo install skaffold /usr/local/bin/    </copy>
    ```

    For more detailed instructions for your specific OS, go to:
    [https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)

## Task 6: Check OpenSSL

1. Make sure you have OpenSSL installed with:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    openssl version
    </copy>
    ```

    See if the command is found or fails. 

    It should be present by default on your machine.


You may proceed to the next lab.
