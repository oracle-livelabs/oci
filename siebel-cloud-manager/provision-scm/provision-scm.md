# Provision the Siebel Cloud Manager Instance

## Introduction

In this lab, we shall first create a new compartment to organize all our lab-related cloud resources. Later, we shall deploy the Siebel Cloud Manager stack to provision a virtual machine that will have the Siebel Cloud Manager application pre-installed.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
*   Create a compartment
*   Create a Siebel Cloud Manager instance from the Marketplace image
*   Verify the Siebel Cloud Manager application

### Prerequisites

* A user with 'manage' access to all resources in the new compartment.
* A user with 'manage' access to Dynamic Groups in Tenancy
* A tenancy with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace containing Siebel Cloud Manager image
* SSH key

## Task 1: Create a compartment

1. Log in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Tenancy and in the console, click the **hamburger icon** and navigate to **Identity and Security** then **Compartments**

   ![Navigate to Compartment](./images/navigate-compartment.png)

2. On the compartments page, click **Create Compartment**

3. Give the **Name** and **Description** as below. In the **Parent Compartment** field choose either the root compartment or any other compartment to which the one we are creating now will be a child.

    **Name**

        <copy>SiebelCloudManager</copy>

    **Description**

        <copy>Compartment for all Siebel Cloud Manager resources</copy>

   ![Create Compartment](./images/create-compartment.png)

4. Click ***Create Compartment*** and the compartment will be created.

5. Note the **OCID** of this compartment.

   ![Copy the Compartment OCID](./images/copy-the-ocid.png)

## Task 2: Create a Siebel Cloud Manager instance from the Marketplace image

Siebel Cloud Manager stack will create the following resources,

   - A subcompartment
   - Network resources like VCN, public/private subnets, security lists, route table and rules, dynamic group, policies, etc.
   - A compute instance with the Siebel Cloud Manager application pre-installed


1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, click the ***hamburger icon***

2. Navigate to **Marketplace** and **All Applications**

   ![Navigate to Marketplace](./images/navigate-marketplace.png)

3. In the search bar, type in **siebel** and hit search. Click ***Siebel Cloud Manager*** image.

   ![Search Siebel](./images/search-scm.png)

4. On the page that appears, choose the latest **Version** and the compartment as **SiebelCloudManager**

5. Click ***Launch Stack***

   ![Launch Stack](./images/launch-stack-Button.png)

6. On the **Create Stack** page, click ***Configure Variables***

7. Fill up the following,

    a. **Root Compartment OCID:** This is the OCID of **SiebelCloudManager** compartment.

    b. **Cloud manager public ssh key:** Either upload or paste the public SSH key that we created as part of Lab 1.

    c. **Resource prefix to name the OCI resources:** scm

    d. Click ***Next*** and review the Stack Information and Configuration Variables. Check **Run Apply**

    e. Click ***Create***

8. Now, we will be directed to the **Stack Details** page and we will see that our terraform apply job is running.

   The **Logs** section will show the progress of the apply job. This can be monitored to check the various resources that are getting created. In case there are any errors, they will be displayed too. After running for a while, the stack apply job's state will show **Succeeded**.

9. In the **Logs** section of the stack apply job, make a note of the following information:
   * **CloudManagerApplication**: The URL for running Siebel Cloud Manager, which uses the public IP address and port number of the newly created instance.
   The output would appear as below.
   ```
   CloudManagerApplication = "http://{Public IP of Siebel Cloud Manager}:16690/"
   ```

## Task 3: Verify the Siebel Cloud Manager application

Once the stack is successfully deployed, the Siebel Cloud Manager instance can be accessed from **Compute** and **Instances** section.

We shall now verify if the Siebel Cloud Manager application is running.

1. Connect to this instance through an ssh client such as PuTTY using the ssh private key that we had used to create this instance. Enter the username as **opc**

2. Run the following command.

   ```
   $ <copy>docker ps</copy>
   (The above command will give the output of the running Siebel cloud manager container)
   ```
   ![docker ps command output](./images/docker-ps.png)

3. To check the response, launch the Cloud Manager Application URL that was shown in the stack apply job.
   ```
   CloudManagerApplication = "http://{Public IP of Siebel Cloud Manager}:16690/"
   ```
![Siebel Cloud Manager UI](./images/scm-ui.png)

The above page indicates that the Siebel Cloud Manager application is up and running.

## Summary

In this lab, the Siebel Cloud Manager instance has been provisioned. In the next lab, we will install and configure a GitLab instance.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
