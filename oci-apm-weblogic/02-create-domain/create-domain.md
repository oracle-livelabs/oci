# Create an APM Domain and obtain Data Upload Endpoint and Private Data Key

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create an APM Domain. You will acquire a Data Upload Endpoint and a Private Data Key, which are needed to configure the APM Tracer on the application.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

*	Create an APM Domain
*	Obtain a Data Upload Endpoint and a Private Data Key


### Prerequisites

* To create an APM domain, you will need an Oracle Cloud Account Administrator role or manage apm-domains permission in the target compartment. For more details, refer to the OCI Documentation, [Create an APM Domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/create-apm-domain.html).

## Task1: Create an APM domain

1.	From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management**, then **Administration**.

3.	Click **Create APM Domain**.

4.	Name your APM domain as **apmworkshop** and select the compartment you created. Add a check to the **Create as Always Free Domain**, then click **Create**.

5. Press the refresh button periodically to check the status. This may take a few minutes.

  For more details on how to create an APM Domain, refer to the OCI documentation, [Create an APM Domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/create-apm-domain.html).

## Task2: Obtain Data Upload Endpoint and Private and Public Data Keys

To upload tracing data to an APM domain, Data Upload Endpoint and both Private and Public Data Keys must be configured in the applicationâ€™s configuration files. Next, you are going to obtain the values for them and then enter them into the Oracle Cloud console.

1.	Click the link to the APM domain.

2. Under **Resources**, click **Data Keys**.

	  ![Oracle Cloud console, APM Domain](images/3-1-2-domain.png " ")

3.	In the **APM Domain Information** tab, find **Data Upload Endpoint**, then click **Copy**. Paste the copied value to a text file and save. You will need this value in the later steps in the workshop.

4.	Under **Data Keys**, find **auto\_generated\_private_data\_key**. Click **Copy** and save the value to the text file.

5.  In the same section, find **auto\_generated\_public_data\_key**. Click **Copy** and save the value to the text file.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
