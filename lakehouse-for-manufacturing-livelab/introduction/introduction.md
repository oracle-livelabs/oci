# Lakehouse for Manufacturing - Livelab

## Introduction

### About the Workshop
The workshop focuses on demonstrating how Oracle Manufacturing Lakehouse helps the business in monitoring the Operational matrices and optimizing the supply chain using the Out of the box AI and ML capabilities of OCI. The Workshop has been designed to get a hands-on experience in Manufacturing Lakehouse and learn to leverage the next-age OCI AI/ML services for customer demonstrations, designing POC and as an implementation accelerator for Lakehouse.

A data Lakehouse is a modern, open architecture that enables you to store, understand, and analyze all your data. It combines the power and richness of data warehouses with the breadth and flexibility of the most popular open-source data technologies you use today. A data Lakehouse can be built from the ground up on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to work with the latest AI frameworks and prebuilt AI services like Oracleâ€™s language service.
