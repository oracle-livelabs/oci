# Evaluate yield forecast using OCI forecasting service

## Introduction

Accessing the product yield and quality is one of the essential tasks for the manufacturing industry which helps them in rapid decision-making for companies. Yield Forecasting helps in accessing what and when to manufacture based on different external KPIs such as product demand, advertisement, and campaign data sets.

OCI Forecasting is a fully managed AI service that uses machine learning and statistical algorithms to deliver highly accurate time-series forecasts. It is capable of handling univariate or multivariate use cases and can forecast a variety of business metrics including product demands, sales, service requests, etc. The service builds multiple models and ensembles to create the best one to maximize forecast accuracy using AutoML. It delivers forecasts with confidence intervals and explains the ability to bring transparency and aid in appropriate business decisions.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn:
* About OCI Forecasting service
* How to upload objects in a bucket
* How to create datasets for the Forecasting service

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab
* Familiar with OCI Policy.
* The service is now available in OC1- Phoenix region.
* Familiar with Python programming for SDK usage is recommended.
* Request access to OCI Forecasting + review policy requirements.




## Task 1: Understand and Download AI Forecasting datasets

Download the data sets below from the given link.

* prim-load-yield.csv         \-This contain around 1-year primary data for forecasting.
* additional-datasetyield.csv \-This is additional data set with 1 more dimension (down time) for forecasting
* Download the [prim-load-yield](files/prim-load-yield.csv).
* Download the [additional-datasetyield](files/additional-datasetyield.csv).


## Task 2: Upload Forecasting Datasets to Object Store
Follow these steps to upload datasets to the object store.

1. In the console navigation menu, click **Storage**.

2. Under **Object Storage & Archive Storage**, click **Buckets**.

3. Click the **Create Bucket** button. The **Create Bucket** page is displayed.

4. Provide the appropriate bucket name and leave the rest as defaults and click **Create**.

5. Click on the created bucket.

6. Click on the **Edit Visibility** button and choose option **Public** and **Save Changes**.

	![Save Changes](images/save-edit-visibility.png)

7. Click on the **Upload button** at the bottom of the page and choose option **select files**.

8. Browse the forecasting datasets and after selecting click on the **Upload** button.

## Task 3: Create Forecasting Project
Follow these steps to create a Forecasting model.

1. Select region as **US West (Phoenix)**.
2. In the console navigation menu, click **Analytics & AI**.
3. Under **AI services**, click **Forecasting**.

4. From the Forecasting Console page, under **Forecasting**, click **Projects**.
   The **Project List** page is displayed.
5. Click **Create Project**.
   The **Create Project** panel is displayed.
6. Select a **Compartment** to create the Project.
7. Give appropriate Project **Name**.  
8. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for the Project. It should help others identify it.
9. Click **Create Project**.

## Task 4: Create Data Assets
Before we can create any forecast we need to create a data asset which is ideally telling the AI Service to use that as the training dataset to create the forecast.

Follow these steps to upload datasets to the object store.

1. From the Forecasting Console page, under **Forecasting**, click **Projects**.
   The **Project List** page is displayed.
	 	![Project List](images/project-list.png)
2. Select the project created in the previous task.
3. Choose **Data Assets** from the left and click on the **Create data asset** button.
    ![Data Asset](images/create-data-asset.png)
4. Give appropriate **Data asset Name**, and **Bucket name** and select the dataset from the bucket.  
5. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for the data asset. It should help others identify it.
6. Click **Create**.
   ![Create Data Asset](images/create-dataasset.png)
7. Create a dataset that should appear in the list
   ![Data Asset List](images/data-asset-list.png)
8. Repeat the above process for additional data sets as well.

## Task 5: Create a Forecast for the data asset created

In this task we will learn how to create a forecast using the AI Forecasting service.

Follow these steps to upload datasets to the object store.

1. From the project Console page, choose **Forecasts** and click on the **Create Forecast** button.
  ![Create Forecast](images/forecast-create.png)
2. Choose option **Choose existing data asset** and select **Data asset** & **Additional training data asset**which were created in the previous task. Click Next.
  ![Existing Data Asset](images/existing-data-asset.png)
	![Additional Data Asset](images/additional-data-asset.png)
3. Fill **Column Name** & **Data type** for both data assets along with Time **stamp column format**, **Data frequency** & **Timestamp column name**. Click **Next**.
  ![Name and Data Type](images/column-data-type1.png)
	![Name and Data Type](images/column-data-type2.png)
4. Give an appropriate **Forecast name** and choose a **Target variables** (should not be a string) from the data asset for forecasting. Fill up the **Forecast horizon** (i.e. Number of time steps into the future for which we want the forecasts) and choose **Is data grouped**? field as Data is grouped for this lab and click **Next**.

	![Forecast Details](images/forecasting-details2.png)
5. Review the form and click on **Submit**.
  ![Review and Submit](images/review-submit.png)
6. Within a few minutes the Forecast should appear with the status as **Active**.

## Task 6: Review Forecasting Model.

Let's look at the forecasting results in this part of the Lab.

Once training and selecting the best model based on Hyperparameter tuning and ROCV error is done i.e. AUTOML has done its magic you can view the results for each time series.

From the multiple time series choose A05 from the drop-down and you can the respective visualizations including the details for the type of algorithm, Preprocessing, etc.
