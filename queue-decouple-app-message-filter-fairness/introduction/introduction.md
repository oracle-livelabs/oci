# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Queue is a fully managed, high-throughput messaging service designed to enable secure communication between decoupled application components or microservices. By leveraging OCI Queue, developers can implement scalable, resilient, and loosely coupled architectures to support asynchronous messaging and ensure system flexibility.
In this workshop, you will learn to create and manage OCI Queues and integrate them with various SDKs and APIs to develop decoupled applications. Whether you're using the OCI SDKs or open-source protocols like STOMP, this hands-on experience will help you understand key features like message fairness, channel management, and more.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* **Deploy OCI Queue** Learn how to provision and configure an OCI Queue to enable asynchronous communication for your applications.
* **Decouple Application Components/ Micro-services using the OCI Queue SDK** Implement decoupling patterns between micro-services using the OCI Queue SDK.
* **Queue Channels - Filter Messages and Messaging Fairness using OCI Queue SDK** Explore how to send and receive messages from specific queue channels while ensuring messaging fairness and proper load distribution.
* **Decouple Application Components/ Micro-services Using Open-Source STOMP API** Understand how to integrate OCI Queue with the widely adopted open-source STOMP protocol.
* **Queue Channels - Filter Messages and Messaging Fairness using open source STOMP API** Combine the capabilities of OCI Queue and STOMP APIs to develop messaging systems with channel-specific fairness.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle account.
* Familiarity with queue and concepts of micro-services are required.
* Some understanding of Linux shell commands.
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) components like OCI Compute, networking.
* Basic familiarity with python.
