# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Manual inventory management can be a time consuming and labor intensive process. Manufacturers often struggle with keeping an updated stock of inventory and keeping track of inventory location, leading to lost revenue and under-utilised capital. The inventory counting process on-site for large remote factories or warehouse facilities involves time and resource intensive steps, constraints and is prone to errors.
OCI Vision can be used to supplement manual inventory management efforts by using drones (or other robots) to observe, count and report information reliably and faster.  
  
This workshop features elements of the recently developed proof-of-concept for Oracle Industry Lab, where the goal was to use stacked pipes as an example of an automated inventory counting scenario, using a programmable drone and a trained, custom OCI Vision model.

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

## Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
- Understand the prerequisites and prepare your tenancy for the creation of an OCI Vision model
- Label images with OCI Data Labeling
- Build a custom Vision model
