# Trigger the OCI Vision model creation and training

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create an OCI Vision project and an OCI Vision custom model. A custom model can be created with a minimum of 10 images, which we have provided. For production models though, we recommend using many more images for training.

An OCI Vision custom model can be created in quick mode (up to 1 hour), regular mode (up to 24 hours), or custom mode. In the lab steps, we will use quick mode training since we're limited on time.

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

- Become familiar with OCI Vision
- Understand the OCI Vision resource hierarchy
- Create an OCI Vision custom model for Object Detection 

## Task 1: Create an OCI Vision project

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, click the main menu icon to open the side menu.
2. Click **Analytics & AI** and then click **Vision**.
3. On the left side of the screen, click **Projects**, under Custom Models.

4. Click **Create project**. Provide *vision-project* as name, select *vision-livelab* as compartment, and click **Create project**.

## Task 2: Create the OCI Vision pipe detection model

1. Once the project status is *Active*, select *vision-project*.
2. While on the OCI Vision project details page, click **Create Model**.

2. Select *Object Detection* in model type.
3. Select *Choose existing dataset*, *Data Labeling Service*, and select the *vision-livelab-dataset* bucket.
