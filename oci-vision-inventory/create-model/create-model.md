# Trigger the OCI Vision model creation and training

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create an OCI Vision project and an OCI Vision custom model. A custom model can be created with a minimum of 10 images, which we have provided.   
An OCI Vision custom model can be created in quick mode (up to 1 hour), regular mode (up to 24 hours), or custom mode. In the lab steps, we propose the quick mode, with a fast completion of the workshop in mind. Whenever suitable, we recommend the regular mode.

### Objectives

- Become familiar with OCI Vision
- Understand the OCI Vision resource hierarchy
- Create an OCI Vision custom model for Object Detection 

## Task 1: Create an OCI Vision project

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, click the main menu icon to open the side menu.
2. Click **Analytics & AI** and then click **Vision**.
3. On the left side of the screen, click **Projects**, under Custom Models.
