# Access OCI Vision in DataScience Notebook Session

## Introduction

In this lab session, we will show you how to access OCI Vision services in a DataScience Notebook.

The Datascience Notebook is a web application that contains code, results and visualizations that makes testing and sharing ML pipelines simple.

*Estimated Time*: 60 minutes

### Objectives
* Learn how to use Vision Services within a DataScience notebook.

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using Data Science, your tenancy administrator should set up the following networking, dynamic group, and policies.

1. Create VCN and Subnets

    Create a VCN and subnets using Virtual Cloud Networks > Start VCN Wizard > VCN with Internet Connectivity option.
    The Networking Quickstart option automatically creates the necessary private subnet with a NAT gateway.

2. Create Dynamic Group

    Create a dynamic group with the following matching rule:
    ALL { resource.type = 'datasciencenotebooksession' }

3. Create Policies

    Create a policy in the root compartment with the following statements:

    * Service Policies
        ```
        <copy>allow service datascience to use virtual-network-family in tenancy</copy>
        ```

    * Non-Administrator User Policies
        ```
        <copy>
        allow group <data-scientists> to use virtual-network-family in tenancy
        </copy>
        ```
        ```
        <copy>
        allow group <data-scientists> to manage data-science-family in tenancy
        </copy>
        ```

        where data-scientists represents the name of your user group.

    * Dynamic Group Policies
        ```
        <copy>allow dynamic-group <dynamic-group> to manage data-science-family in tenancy</copy>
        ```

        where dynamic-group represents the name of your dynamic group.


## Task 1: Navigate to the Data Science Notebook Session

5. Create Notebook Session

    Click Create Notebook Session to create a new Notebook session.
        ![Create Notebook Session](./images/create-notebook-session.png " ")

6. Enter Notebook Details

    Select a name.
    Choose Intel Skylake VM.Standard2.2 as the shape. 
    Set block storage to 50 GB.
    Select the subnet with Internet connectivity. (Select private subnet if you have use VCN Wizard to create VCN)
        ![Enter Notebook Details](./images/create-notebook-session2.png " ")

7. Open the OCI Data Science notebook

    The Notebook Session VM will be created. This might take a few minutes. When created you will see a screen like the following.
    Open the notebook session that was provisioned.
        ![Open the OCI Data Science notebook](./images/open-notebook.png " ")

## Task 2: Setup API Signing Key and Config File

Generate an API signing key pair

1. Open User Settings

    Open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and click User Settings.
        ![Open User Settings](./images/user-profile-icon.png " ")

2. Open API Key

    Navigate to API Key and then Click Add API Key.
        ![Open API Key](./images/add-api-button.png " ")

3. Generate API Key

    In the dialog, select Generate API Key Pair. Click Download Private Key, save the key file and then click Add.
        ![Generate API Key](./images/gen-api.png " ")


4. Generate Config File

    Copy the values shown on the console.
        ![Generate Config File](./images/conf.png " ")

    Create a config file and paste the values copied.
    Replace the key_file value with the path of your generated API Key.
        ![Create a config file and paste the values copied.](./images/config2.png " ")

    The private key and config files will be utilized in the next tasks.

5. Setup in DataScience Notebook

    Open the Notebook session you created in Task 1. Open the Terminal by clicking the Terminal icon in the Launcher Tab.

    In the terminal, create a .oci directory in the Data Science notebook session.
        ```
        <copy>mkdir ~/.oci</copy>
        ```

    Upload the Config file and the Private Key to the Notebook Session by clicking on the Upload Files Icon you just created.

    In the terminal, move those files to the .oci folder.
        ```
        <copy>mv <path of the config file> ~/.oci/</copy>
        ```
        ```
        <copy>mv <path of the private key> ~/.oci/</copy>
