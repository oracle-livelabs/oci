## Task 1: Strategic Procurement – Negotiations (Sourcing)


1. 

  You need to figure out why the Automatic Award Recommendation has elected not to award EIP Inc. this negotiation. You will need to go to the negotiations page.

    > Navigate to the **Procurement** tab and select **Negotiations**.

2. 

  This is the negotiations dashboard that has Infolets with insights into sourcing programs and activity. This information is drillable to give the user an intuitive experience. You need to drill into Award Completed to analyze the recent sourcing negotiation.

    > In the **‘My Negotiations’** Infolet select the **‘Award Completed’** piece of the pie chart (Purple).

3. 

  You could drill into the negotiation details by clicking the hyperlink. However, you need to analyze the individual supplier responses, so you need to click the monitor icon.

    > Click the **‘Monitor’** icon for Negotiation **31803**.

    ![drill](images/3-task1-strategic-procurement-negotiations-sourcing.png)

4. 

  Here is the initial monitor page with analytical information about responses.  
  Notice EIP was ranked first, but wasn’t awarded.  Let’s dive deeper to find why.  
  We can use the analytical tools available through Cloud Procurement to analyze further.
  
    > Select **Actions** drop-down menu, then click **Analyze**, select **Analyze Negotiation** from the drop-down menu.

  With analytics built into the sourcing process, we see awards details, savings analysis, and supplier response information. 

    > Click **Scroll-bar** down to bottom of page.

6. 

    Notice EIP is ranked first, but has lowest score.  

     > Click the **score ‘45’** to access EIP’s response details.
   
    ![Scroll bar](images/6-task1-strategic-procurement-negotiations-sourcing.png)

7. 

  Now we see how the Procurement system AI scored a zero and automatically disqualified EIP because they are missing a required certification which was set as pre-built knockout criteria.

    > Click the **attachment icon** to access the internal note left by the evaluator.
