Estimated Time: 5 minutes


### Objectives

## Task 1: Strategic Procurement – Negotiations (Sourcing)


1. 

  You need to figure out why the Automatic Award Recommendation has elected not to award EIP Inc. this negotiation. You will need to go to the negotiations page.

    > Navigate to the **Procurement** tab and select **Negotiations**

2. 

  This is the negotiations dashboard that has Infolets with insights into sourcing programs and activity. This information is drillable to give the user an intuitive experience. You need to drill into Award Completed to analyze the recent sourcing negotiation.

    > In the **‘My Negotiations’** Infolet select the **‘Award Completed’** piece of the pie chart (Purple)

3. 

  You could drill into the negotiation details by clicking the hyperlink. However, you need to analyze the individual supplier responses, so you need to click the monitor icon.

    > Click the **‘Monitor’** icon for Negotiation **31796**

    ![drill](images/3-strategic-procurement.png)

4. 

  Here is the initial monitor page with analytical information about responses.  
  Notice EIP was ranked first, but wasn’t awarded.  Let’s dive deeper to find why.  
  We can use the analytical tools available through Cloud Procurement to analyze further.
  
    > Select **Actions** drop-down menu, then click **Analyze**, select **Analyze Negotiation** from the drop-down menu
    
      ![change](images/4-strategic-procurement.png)

1. 

  With analytics built into the sourcing process, we see awards by supplier, total savings, and savings by line item.  
  At the bottom of the page are supplier response information where we can pull in response details to see why EIP Inc wasn’t awarded this negotiation despite the highest savings potential.

    > Click **Scroll-bar** down to bottom of page

    ![Scroll bar](images/5-strategic-procurement.png)


6. 

     > Click the **white space next to ‘Supplier’** as indicated (in blue).

     > Click **Analyze**
   
    ![Scroll bar](images/6-strategic-procurement.png)

7. 

  Additional built-in analytics provide further insights about savings and response scores.  
  As you scroll down you see a summary of response elements.  
  To drill deeper and find out specifically why EIP was not awarded, we can evaluate the response details.  
  To do this:

    > Select the **Actions** drop-down and click “**Add or Remove Response Elements**”
  
    > Next, highlight “**Requirements: All Levels**” and click the single **right arrow icon**
  
    > Click OK

8. 

  Now we can see how the Procurement system AI has automatically disqualified EIP because they are missing a required certification.
