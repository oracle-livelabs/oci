# Introduction

Experience the pre-built AI features embedded in Fusion applications

## About this AI Experience

A Sales VP led his team of three seasoned account managers to a high stakes meeting with a leading tech company headquartered in Phoenix. Their mission: to position their company as the primary supplier of cutting-edge solar panels for the company’s upcoming data center builds. After meticulous planning, the team arrived at the client’s headquarters, ready to showcase how their advanced solar technology, robust supply chain, and consistent manufacturing quality could help the tech company drive renewable adoption and meet ambitious sustainability goals. The meeting ended on a positive note, with strong interest expressed by the provider’s executive team. Now, the Sales Director leverages Oracle’s embedded AI tools to manage all post-meeting tasks—tracking follow-up actions, tailoring solution proposals, and expediting internal approvals—to ensure the sales process proceeds seamlessly and the partnership moves forward without setbacks.
