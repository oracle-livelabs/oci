# Create Cloud Native Applications on Compute

## Introduction

Estimated time: 10 min

### Objectives

![Architecture Compute](images/architecture_compute.png =50%x*)

In this sample, using terraform, we will create:
- a compute (VM)
- with a Java program, 
- HTML pages (on NGINX)
- and an Autonomous Database. 

The steps are identical for all other user interfaces, backends or database.

### Prerequisites

Please read the chapter: Introduction and Get Started.

You are in the Green Button version of the lab. The lab is limited only to Compute and Autonomous Database due the limits of the green button 
cloud account. 

  ![OCI Starter Green Button Limit](images/starter-compute-green-button-limits.png =50%x*)

If later, you want to try the full version of the lab for ex with Kubernetes or Container engine, you will need your own tenancy.

## Task 1: Create the Application

1. Using your browser, go to https://www.ocistarter.com/
2. Choose 
    - Advanced
    - Existing VCN (This is needed to use the VCN created by the Green Button) 
    - Compute
    - HTML
    - Java
    - SpringBoot
    - Autonomous database
3. Click *Cloud Shell*
    - You will see the commands to use.

4. Login to your OCI account
    - Click *Code Editor*
    - Click *New Terminal*
    - Copy paste the command below. And check the README.md
    ```
    <copy>
    curl -k "https://www.ocistarter.com/app/zip?prefix=starter&deploy=compute&ui=html&language=java&database=atp&vcn_strategy=existing" --output starter.zip
    unzip starter.zip
    cd starter
    cat README.md
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Main files

1. In the code editor:
    - Click *File* / *Open*
    - Choose the directory *starter*
    - Click *Open*
    ![Editor File Open](images/starter-compute-dir.png)
2. The main files are:
    - Commands:
        - build.sh      : Build the whole program: Run Terraform, Configure the DB, Build the App, Build the UI
        - destroy.sh    : Destroy the objects created by Terraform
        - env.sh        : Contains the settings of your project
    - Directories:
        - src           : Sources files
            - app         : Source of the Backend Application (Command: build_app.sh)
            - ui          : Source of the User Interface (Command: build_ui.sh)
            - db          : SQL files of the database
            - terraform   : Terraform scripts (Command: plan.sh / apply.sh)
            - compute     : Contains the deployment files to Compute
        - bin           : with some helper commands
            - bin/ssh\_compute.sh (to ssh to the Compute)
            - bin/ssh\_bastion.sh (to ssh to the Bastion)
3. Edit the env.sh file:
    - Choose the env.sh file.
    - Look for \_\_TO_FILL\_\_ in the file
        - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        - export TF\_VAR\_vcn\_ocid="\_\_TO_FILL\_\_"
        - export TF\_VAR\_public\_subnet\_ocid="\_\_TO_FILL\_\_"
        - export TF\_VAR\_private\_subnet\_ocid="\_\_TO_FILL\_\_"
        - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - You may leave the database password. If not filled, the "db password" will be randomly generated.
    - Ideally, you can also use an existing compartment if you have one. 
        - If not, the script will create a "oci-starter" compartment

## Task 3: Build.sh

During the build, Terraform will create:
- Network resources: VCN, Subnet
- A database
- A compute instance to run NGINX + the Java App
- A bastion used mostly to populate the database with the table

1. In the code editor, 
    - in the menu *Terminal / New Terminal*. 
    - then run:
    ```
    <copy>
    ./build.sh
    </copy>
    ```
    - It will build all and at the end you will see:
    ```
    <copy>
    - User Interface : http://123.123.123.123/
    - Rest DB API : http://123.123.123.123/app/dept
    - Rest Info API : http://123.123.123.123/app/info
    </copy>
    ```
2. Click on the URL or go to the link to check that it works:
    - All running in a Compute 
    - You have HTML pages in NGINX doing REST calls 
    - To a Java SpringBoot backend
    - That backend gets data from the Autonomous database.

## Task 4: More info

### Customize

Please also check the  "Lab 5 - How to Customize" to see how to customize this sample to your needs

### SSH

During the build, it has generated 2 files:
- id\_starter\_rsa : a ssh private key to login to the compute and bastion
- id\_starter\_rsa.pub : the public ssh private key installed in the compute and bastion

You can login to the compute by running:
```
<copy>
bin/ssh_compute.sh
</copy>
```

The interesting directories are:
- $HOME/app with the compiled application
- /usr/share/nginx/html/ with the HTML pages

### Cleanup

1. To clean up, run 
    ```
    <copy>
    ./destroy.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ..
    rm -R starter
    </copy>
    ```
