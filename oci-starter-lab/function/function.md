# Create Cloud Native Serverless Functions

## Introduction

Estimated time: 10 min

### Objectives

![Architecture Function](images/architecture_function.png =50%x*)

In this sample, using terraform, we will create: 
- a Serverless Function with Python
- an Object Storage for the HTML
- and an Autonomous Database. 

The steps are identical for all other user interfaces, backends or database.

### Prerequisites

Please read the chapter: Introduction and Get Started.

## Task 1: Create the Application

1. Using your browser, go to https://www.ocistarter.com/
2. Choose 
    - Function
    - HTML
    - Python
    - Autonomous Database
3. Click *Cloud Shell*
    - You will see the commands to use.

4. Login to your OCI account
    - Click *Code Editor*
    - Click *New Terminal*
    - Copy paste the command below. And check the README.md
    ```
    <copy>
    curl "https://www.ocistarter.com/app/zip?prefix=starter&deploy=function&ui=html&language=python&database=atp" --output starter.zip
    unzip starter.zip
    cd starter
    cat README.md
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Main files

1. In the code editor:
    - Click *File* /  *Open*
    - Choose the directory *starter*
    - Click *Open*
    ![Editor File Open](images/starter-compute-dir.png)
2. The main files are:
    - Commands
        - build.sh      : Build the whole program: Run Terraform, Configure the DB, Build the App, Build the UI
        - destroy.sh    : Destroy the objects created by Terraform
        - env.sh        : Contains the settings of your project
    - Directories
        - src           : Sources files
            - app         : Source of the Backend Application (Command: build_app.sh)
            - ui          : Source of the User Interface (Command: build_ui.sh)
            - db          : SQL files of the database
            - terraform   : Terraform scripts (Command: plan.sh / apply.sh)
        - bin            : with some helper commands
            - bin/ssh\_bastion.sh (to ssh to the Bastion)
3. We will need an AUTH Token to login to the Docker Container Registry. Let's create one:
    - Click on the top left icon
    - Click your username
    - In the menu on the right, choose Auth Tokens
    - Click *Generate Token*
    - Give a name 
    - Click *Generate Token*
    - Then copy the value ##AUTH-TOKEN##
    ![Auth Token](images/starter-auth-token.png)
4. Edit the env.sh file:
    - Choose the env.sh file.
    - Look for \_\_TO_FILL\_\_ in the file
    - For TF\_VAR\_auth\_token, use the ##AUTH-TOKEN## value that you just above. 
    - For TF\_VAR\_database\_password, You may leave it like this.
        - If not filled, the "db password" will be randomly generated
    - Ideally, you can also use an existing compartment if you have one. 
        - If not, the script will create a "oci-starter" compartment

## Task 3: Build.sh

Before to run the build. Notice that the build will create:
- Network resources: VCN, Subnet
- An Autonomous Database database
- An API Gateway to route the HTTP Requests to the Function or Object Storage
- An Function Application with one function
- An Object Storage with the HTML files
- A bastion used mostly to populate the database with the table

1. In the code editor, 
    - in the menu *Terminal / New Terminal*. 
    - then run:
    ```
    <copy>
    ./build.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    It will build all and at the end you will see:
    ```
    <copy>
    - User Interface : https://xxxxxx.apigateway.eu-xxxx.oci.customer-oci.com/starter/
    - Rest DB API : https://xxxxxx.apigateway.eu-xxxx.oci.customer-oci.com/starter/dept
    - Rest Info API : https://xxxxxx.apigateway.eu-xxxx.oci.customer-oci.com/starter/info
    </copy>
    ```
2. Notice, during a cold start, the first function call with take about 40 secs to run. If you want instant response, you need to configure the [Provisioned Concurrency](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Functions/Tasks/functionsusingprovisionedconcurrency.htm].
3. Click on the URL or go to the link to check that it works:
    - All running in Serverless Mode 
    - You have HTML pages stored in Object Storage doing REST calls 
    - To a Python backend
    - That backend gets data from an Autonomous Database

## Task 4: More info

### Customize
Please also check the  "Lab 5 - How to Customize" to see how to customize this sample to your needs

### Object Storage
During the build, it will generate an Object Storage to store the HTML file.
In the OCI menu, go to Storage / Buckets
You will find a bucket : starter-public-bucket with the HTML files.

### Function
It will also create a Function Application.
In the OCI menu, go to Developer Services / Function Application
You will find a Application starter-fn-application

### Cleanup

1. To clean up, run 
    ```
    <copy>
    ./destroy.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ..
    rm -R starter
    </copy>
    ```
