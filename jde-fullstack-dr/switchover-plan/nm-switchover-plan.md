# Create and Customize the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will create a DR Switchover plan and customize the plan with the additional steps. Ashburn is the primary region and Phoenix is the standby region. FSDR provides two types of plan

- Switchover (Maintenance/Planned Disaster Recovery)
- Failover   (Actual Disaster Recovery/Unplanned)
- Start drill (Validating DR affectiveness by creating a replica)
- Stop drill (Removing the replica created by start drill)

This lab will focus on how to create a Switchover plan and customize the plan as per the JDE application requirements. 

**DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Phoenix)**. It is because, in the case of the worst-case scenario, the entire primary region outside the FSDR will not be accessible from the primary region.

Estimated Time: 40 Minutes

### Objectives

- Create a Switchover plan
- Customize the Switchover plan - Start E1 Services and Agents
- Customize the Switchover plan - Start Agents and Node Manager on Web Server and SM Server
- Customize the Switchover plan - Start WebLogic on Web Servers and SM Server


## Task 1: Create a Switchover plan

1. Login into OCI Console. Select region as **Phoenix**.

   ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region1.png)

2. Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Phoenix**

    ![phoenix region drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgpage.png)

3. You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Phoenix region. **DR Plans always be created in the Standby DRPG (Phoenix region)**

    ![drpg home](./images/phoenix-drpg.png)

4. Select the **FSDR\_Non-Moving\_Ash\_to\_Phx\_DB\_with\_All Steps** DRPG and navigate to Plans under the resources section. Click on Create Plan.

  ![drpg dr plan](./images/nm-phoenix-drplan.png)

  Provide a name for the Switchover Plan.

  Select Plan type as **Switchover (planned)**.

  ![drpg create plan](./images/nm-phoenix-create-drplan.png)

  Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within few minutes, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

  ![drpg plan created](./images/nm-phoenix-drplan-created.png)

  Select the **JDE\_FSDR\_Non-Moving Plan\_Ash to Phx** plan, and you should be able to see the built-in plan groups.

  ![drpg plan details](./images/nm-phoenix-drplan-groups.png)

  Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, FSDR created these built-in plans. As we have added the Database as a member in the primary region, it has created the build in steps for DB only. We will add the steps to update and start the other JDE servers in separate custom groups. 
  
  *Note:* To create a DR Plan using CLI, please follow the link [Automate FSDR with CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en/learn/full-stack-dr-oci-cli-command/#introduction)
