# Create and Customize the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will create a DR Switchover plan and customize the plan with the additional steps. Ashburn is the primary region and Phoenix is the standby region. FSDR provides below types of plans.

- Switchover (Maintenance/Planned Disaster Recovery)
- Failover   (Actual Disaster Recovery/Unplanned)
- Start drill (Validating DR affectiveness by creating a replica)
- Stop drill (Removing the replica created by start drill)

This lab will focus on how to create a Switchover plan and customize the plan as per the JDE application requirements. 

**DR Plan *must* be created in the standby region (Phoenix)**. It is because, in the case of the worst-case scenario, the entire primary region outside the FSDR will not be accessible from the primary region.

Estimated Time: 40 Minutes

## Task 1: Create a Switchover plan

1. Login into OCI Console. Select region as **Phoenix**.

   ![phoenix region](./images/phoenix-region1.png)

2. Select Migration and Disaster Recovery from the Hamburger menu, then **Disaster Recovery** -> **DR Protection Groups**. Verify the region is **Phoenix**

    ![phoenix region drpg](./images/phoenix-drpgpage.png)

3. You will land on the Disaster Recovery Protection group home page; make sure you have selected the Phoenix region. **DR Plans always be created in the Standby DRPG (Phoenix region)**

    ![drpg home](./images/phoenix-drpg.png)

4. Select the **FSDR\_Moving\_Ash\_to\_Phx\_DB\_with\_All Steps\_Standby** DRPG and navigate to Plans under the resources section. Click on Create Plan.

  ![drpg dr plan](./images/phoenix-drplan.png)

  Provide a name for the Switchover Plan.

  Select Plan type as **Switchover (planned)**.

  ![drpg create plan](./images/phoenix-create-drplan.png)

  Refresh the DR Plan page if required. You can monitor the request's status in the **Work requests** section under Resources. Within few minutes, the plan will get created, and it should be in *active* State.

  ![drpg plan created](./images/phoenix-drplan-created.png)

  Select the **JDE\_FSDR\_Switchover\_Ashburn\_to\_Phoenix** plan, and you should be able to see the built-in plan groups.

  ![drpg plan details](./images/phoenix-drplan-details.png)

  Based on the members we added in both primary and standby DRPG, FSDR created these built-in plans.
  
  ![phoenix-precheck-builtin](./images/phoenix-precheck-builtin.png)

  - **Built-in Prechecks** - These are the prechecks for the plan with all servers and database. Expand to see all steps and details.

  - **Stop Compute Instances** - Stopping all the instances in the primary as a part of moving instance.

  - **Switchover Volume Groups** - Restore volume group switchover.

  - **Switchover Databases** - Database switchover to standby using dataguard.

  - **Launch Compute Instances** - Launch the compute instances at the standby region as a part of moving instance.

  - **Reverse Volume Groups' Replication** - Reverse volume group.

  - **Terminate Compute Instances** - Terminate compute instances at primary, this is disabled by default.

  - **Remove Compute Instances from DR Protection Group** - Remove Compute Instances from DR Protection Group.

  - **Terminate Compute Instances** - Terminate compute instances at primary, this is disabled by default.

  - **Terminate Volume Groups** - Terminate volume group.

  - **Remove Volume Groups from DR Protection Group** - StepsRemove Volume Groups from DR Protection Group.
