# Bring the business back to Primary region

Once the DR situation is over, customer's might need to start using the servers and databases on the primary region like they did prior to the switchover or failover. 

This can be achieved by following the steps in Lab 1.1 to Lab 1.5 including the pre-requisites setup done at the standby region.
