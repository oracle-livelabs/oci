# Perform pre-checks for the DR Switchover Plan

## Introduction

In this lab, we will execute **Run Prechecks** for the **FSDR_Moving\_Ash\_to\_Phx\_DB\_with\_All Steps\_Standby** switchover plan, which we have created in lab 1.2.

Execute **Run Prechecks**  will perform only the *pre-checks* and not the actual execution. Having the pre-checks completed successfully is essential as a pre-requisite for running the actual switchover plan.

Estimated Time: 15 Minutes

### Objectives

- Perform Run prechecks for the plan
- Monitor the executed prechecks

## Task 1: Perform Run prechecks for the Switchover plan

## Task 2: Monitor the executed prechecks

1. Navigate to **Plan executions** section under **Resources** and select the **Precheck_1** plan execution. Initially, it will show the status as **ACTIVE** all the **Built-in Prechecks** as *Queued*

2. After few seconds, the status should change to **IN PROGRESS** including the steps in the group.

3. In few minutes, the status should change to **SUCCEEDED** including the steps and the groups. You can verify the duration of each step and status.
