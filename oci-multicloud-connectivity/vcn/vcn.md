# Setup a Virtual Cloud Network

## Introduction

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### About Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs)

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) provide customizable and private cloud networks in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Just like a traditional data center network, the VCN provides customers with complete control over their cloud networking environment. This includes assigning private IP address spaces, creating subnets and route tables, and configuring stateful firewalls.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Build a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) using the VCN Wizard

### Prerequisites

* OCI console access with VCN deployment permissions

### Video Walkthrough
