# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Estimated Time: 60 - 90 minutes

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Networking is a core tenet of a MultiCloud architecture. This Hands On Lab will walk through the steps required to connect Oracle Cloud to 3rd party cloud infrastructure by utilizing an Oracle Cloud private connectivity offering. After the networking dependencies are met, you will test connectivity between cloud providers to verify the configuration.

To gain more familiarity with Oracle Cloud's networking concepts, I would recommend watching our introductory [Oracle Cloud Networking YouTube series](https://youtu.be/mIYSgeX5FkM) as well as the [Oracle Cloud Networking Overview Documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm) to become more familiar with Oracle Cloud's networking components and their relationships.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Deploy a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
* Deploy a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG).
* Deploy a Virtual Machine.
* Setup a FastConnect Connection.
* Verify MultiCloud Connectivity.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Administrative Oracle Cloud Access to provision networking and compute resources and are subscribed to the Ashburn region.
* Administrative 3rd party cloud provider (Azure, GCP, AWS, etc) to provision networking and compute resources.
* Access to the Megaport or Equinix portal **OR** access to an [Azure Interconnect region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-oci-overview#region-availability).
