# Azure Interconnect

## Introduction

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### About FastConnect

FastConnect allows customers to connect directly external environments such as 3rd party cloud providers and on-premise data centers to their Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) virtual cloud network via dedicated, private, high-bandwidth connections.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Use the Microsoft Azure Console to deploy the required network resources for the Azure Interconnect.
* Use the Microsoft Azure Console to deploy a virtual machine to test and verify connectivity with Oracle Cloud.
* Use the Oracle Cloud Console to create a FastConnect to directly connect to Azure ExpressRoute.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All tasks completed from Lab 1 and 2.
* Unrestricted lab access to your Microsoft Azure tenancy
* The OCI and Azure region you are connecting are [supported Azure InterConnect regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-oci-overview#region-availability)
