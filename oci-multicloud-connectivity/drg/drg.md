# Setup a Dynamic Routing Gateway

## Introduction

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### About Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)

A DRG acts as a virtual router, providing a path for traffic between your on-premises networks, cloud provider infrastructure and VCNs, and can also be used to route traffic between VCNs. Using different types of attachments, custom network topologies can be constructed using components in different regions and tenancies.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

* Build a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) to serve as a private connectivity gateway for the VCN deployed in the previous lab

### Prerequisites

* Tasks completed in the previous lab
* OCI console access with DRG deployment permissions

## Task 1: Deploy a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)

1. From the Oracle Cloud Home Page, navigate to **Networking -> Customer Connectivity -> Dynamic Routing Gateway**.

3. Give your DRG a distinct name and make sure it's deploying in the compartment where the other networking objects are deployed. Click **Create Dynamic Routing Gateway** and wait for the DRG to go into an "Available" state.

4. Under **Resources** go to **Virtual Cloud Network Attachments** and click **Create Virtual Network Attachment**.

5. Optionally give the attachment a name, and then select the name of the VCN you created in the previous step. Verify the VCN attachment lifecycle state is "Attached".
