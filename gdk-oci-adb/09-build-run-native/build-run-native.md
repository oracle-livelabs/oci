# Build and run a native executable

## Introduction

This lab describes how to generate and run a native executable for the application, and use it to connect to the OCI Autonomous Database instance.

You will use [GraalVM Native Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/jdk/17/docs/overview/)â€™s ahead-of-time compilation to build a native executable for the application.

At build time, GraalVM analyzes a Java application and its dependencies to identify just what classes, methods, and fields are absolutely necessary, and then generates a native executable with optimized machine code for just these elements.

Native executables built with GraalVM require less memory, are smaller in size, and start upto 100x faster than just-in-time compiled applications running on a Java Virtual Machine.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Build and run a native executable for the application
* Send an HTTP POST request to add a Genre
* Send an HTTP GET request to fetch all the Genres from the database
* Stop the application

## Task 1: Build and run a native executable for the application

1. In the first terminal in VS Code, check the version of the GraalVM native-image utility:

	``` bash
	<copy>
	native-image --version
	</copy>
	```

2. To generate a native executable using Maven, run the following command:

	``` bash
	<copy>
	./mvnw install -pl lib -am && MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=oraclecloud ./mvnw clean package -pl oci -Dpackaging=native-image
	</copy>
	```

   It can take approximately 7-8 minutes to generate the native executable.

3. The native executable is created in the _oci/target_ directory and can be run with the following command:

	``` bash
	<copy>
	MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=oraclecloud oci/target/oci-adb-demo-oci
	</copy>
	```

   The native executable starts instantaneously.

## Task 2: Send an HTTP POST request to add a Genre

1. From the second terminal in VS Code, add a genre using the command below.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/genres" -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' -d '{ "name": "action" }' | jq
	</copy>
	```

## Task 3: Send an HTTP GET request to fetch all Genres from the database

1. From the same terminal in VS Code, check the `genres` present in the database using the `/list` endpoint exposed by the application:

	``` bash
	<copy>
	curl localhost:8080/genres/list | jq
	</copy>
	```

## Task 4: Stop the application

1. In the first terminal in VS Code, use `CTRL+C` to stop the application.

Congratulations! You've successfully completed this lab. Your Java application native executable is now using the OCI Autonomous Database instance as its backend, with secrets in OCI Vault.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
