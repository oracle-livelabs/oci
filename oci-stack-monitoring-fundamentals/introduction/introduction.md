# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will become familiar with Oracle's Stack Monitoring solution. Stack Monitoring is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) cloud-native service to monitor and view the health and performance of an application and its underlying tech stack. Stack Monitoring can discover and monitor applications running within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), on-premises, or another cloud provider.

In this workshop learn how to:
* Identify application outages across your enterprise at a glance utilizing Stack Monitoring's **Enterprise Summary**. 
* Understand how to identify, review and triage any open alarms. 
* See how you can leverage Stack Monitoring's **tier-organized Key Performance Metrics (KPI's)** to review performance outliers. 
* Learn how to dynamically configure the Enterprise Summary to help identify performance problems. The dynamic Enterprise Summary is very useful when you need to swap a metric chart or table with another to troubleshoot an alarm that is not displayed by default.

In this workshop you will get familiar with:
* Stack Monitoring's **home pages** and how to triage open alarms and view metric performance over time. 
* Review Stack Monitoring's **UI driven discovery process**. 
* **Review an open alarm notification**, then review the steps to **configure an alarm**. 
* Utilize Stack Monitoring's **application topology** to identify and troubleshoot issues across an application stack. 
* Leverage Stack Monitoring's **Stack View** to get a holistic perspective of key performance metrics across an entire application. 

While most of what is covered in this workshop is consistent across all applications such as PeopleSoft, the workshop will focus on an E-Business Suite application. 

Estimated time for this workshop: 60 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Stack Monitoring

Stack Monitoring provides easy to use UI driven discovery and monitoring of applications (e.g. E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft) and application stack technologies (e.g. WebLogic, Tomcat, Oracle Database, SQL Server) running on OCI or on-premises. Obtain full-stack visibility into the health of applications such as Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS), and their underlying application servers, databases, and hosts â€“ all viewable together using a single solution. Use one-click discovery to discover all components of applications such as Oracle E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft or application stack technologies such as Oracle WebLogic Domain and Oracle Database. For more information on Stack Monitoring please refer to Stack Monitoring > **[Getting Started](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/stack-monitoring/index.html)** section in the OCI Documentation.
