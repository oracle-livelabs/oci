## Task 2: Identify an alarm

1. Identify an alarm in a firing state

	Let's begin by clicking the count of open alarms at the top right of the Enterprise Summary. 

	![Enterprise Summary, highlighting the total count of open alarms](images/2-1-together.png " ")

	Within the alarms slide-out, you can see the open alarm, **EBS Concurrent Manager Down in Last 60 Min DEMO**. This is a demonstration alarm that represents a Concurrent Manager that has been down in the last 60 minutes. From within this slide-out we can see the alarm severity is **Critical**, as well as the latest trigger time. In the screenshot, the alarm triggered on May 7th 2023, at 14:49 UTC. Lets click the alarm name, **EBS Concurrent Manager Down in Last 60 Min DEMO**, this will open a new browser tab for you to review more details regarding the alarm in the OCI Monitoring Service.

	![Enterprise Summary alarm slide-out, highlighting the alarm, EBS Concurrent Manager Down is Last 60 Min DEMO](images/2-2-together.png " ")

	The OCI Monitoring Service provides additional details of the alarm. From this page, you can identify the severity as critical. The alarm body is brief and contains information on where to begin the alarm investigation and a link to source controlled troubleshooting steps. The dimensions of this alarm, provide context to which Concurrent Manager is alarming, **PROD\_EBS04\_ConcurrentProcessing**.

	![OCI Monitoring Service alarm details page, highlighting the severity, alarm body, and dimensions](images/2-3-together.png " ")

	The alarm history provides context to the alarm state. From here you can see if the alarm recently began to fire or if the alarm is flapping. The table provides the exact time the alarm moved between states. Once you are done reviewing the alarm details, **close the browser tab** to return to the Stack Monitoring.

	![OCI Monitoring Service alarm details page, highlighting a chart depicting the timeline when the alarm began and a table providing the exact time the alarm began firing](images/2-4-together.png " ")

	Lets review this Concurrent Manager's homepage. **Close** the slide-out and return to Enterprise Summary.

## Task 3: Review a Concurrent Manager homepage

1. Review performance charts of a Concurrent Manager

	Remembering back to an earlier lab, the **Enterprise Summary** makes it easy to see the performance of every resource within your enterprise. Stack Monitoring performance charts are organized by tier. Each tier enables you to quickly access the overall load, response, utilization and errors across all resources in that tier. Clicking on a resources data point in the chart will allow you to further investigate metric trends. Using the scatter plot chart **Concurrent Manager requests**, click the plot point of the only Concurrent Manager in this enterprise.

	![Enterprise Summary, highlighting the EBS Concurrent Manager chart](images/3-1-together.png " ")	

	Clicking the plot point invokes a slide-out showing more details of the performance over the last hour for this Concurrent Manager. Update the charts to show the **Last 24 hours**. In the screenshot below, we can see a small dip in the number of concurrent requests by status, which Stack Monitoring has identified as anomalous. We can also see that while the majority of completed requests were successful, some completed with errors. Now let's click the resource name **EBS04a\_ConcurrentProcessing** to continue our investigation by navigating to the resources homepage.

	![Enterprise Summary Concurrent Manager chart slide-out, highlighting the Concurrent Manager resource name hyperlink](images/3-2-together.png " ")	

	Reviewing the Concurrent Manager homepage, you can see the **Availability** of the Concurrent Manager has been down for about 10 minutes in the last hour. Using the **Concurrent Requests by Status** chart, you can see the count of requests in a **Scheduled** state is not climbing. Reviewing the chart **Completed Concurrent Requests**, denotes once again that most jobs are completing successfully, a few have completed with error. Viewing the chart **Capacity Utilization of Concurrent Managers**, you can see each of the Concurrent Managers appear to be at 100% capacity. That indicates a possible issue with Concurrent Manager capacity and needs to be further investigated. Now lets review the overall health and performance of the entire EBS application stack.

2. Navigate an application's topology

	It's easy to identify and navigate to the EBS application associated with this Concurrent Manager. Begin by selecting **Topology** on the left side of the page. Locate the resource **EBS04a** with the type **EBS**. Click the name of the resource **EBS04a** to navigate to the application's homepage.

	![Concurrent Manager Related Resources page, highlighting the resource EBS_PROD_04](images/3-4-together.png)

## Task 4: Review a application homepage

1. Review an E-Business Suite application's homepage

	We can see that an application homepage, such as EBS, is similar to a standard resource homepage with a few additions. You see the overall availability of resources related to this EBS application, which includes concurrent manager, notification mailer, and workflow manager, etc. Stack Monitoring also provides a summary of alarms for the EBS application and its members by severity. 

	![EBS homepage, highlighting overall availability and all open alarms](images/4-1-together.png " ")

	In a previous lab you reviewed the **Alarms** tab. The alarms shown on the EBS homepage are a roll-up of all alarms for EBS and its components, including the concurrent manager, notification mailer, etc. This allows you to view all open alarms related to this EBS application without having to navigate to multiple homepages. Here we can see the same alarm you investigated related to the concurrent manager, **EBS Concurrent Manager Down in Last 60 Min DEMO**, as this alarm is rolled up to the application level. 

	![EBS homepage highlighting details of all open alarms of the EBS application](images/4-2-together.png " ")

	Clicking **Charts** provides quick visibility into the health of the EBS application. Let's begin by expanding the chart time displayed from the **Last 60 Minutes** to **Last 24 Hours**.

	Using the chart **Executed Programs by Running Time** you can easily gain insight into the five longest-running programs. In the screenshot below, we can see the job execution times have remained steady, outside of a small jump. Should you see any long running spikes, an admin can use their domain knowledge to pinpoint a job that is running longer than expected. Again using the screenshot below, the **Completed Requests by Application** chart illustrates how busy a job is to the overall jobs running. The chart **Active User Sessions By Responsibility** in the screenshot below, shows a spike in active user **NULL_KEY** and should be investigated.

	![EBS specific performance charts](images/4-3-together.png " ")

2.	Review an E-Business Suite application Stack View

	Having reviewed EBS application specific metrics, let's investigate the entire EBS application stack using the **Stack View**. Click the **Stack View** tab. 

	* The Stack View provides a holistic perspective of key performance metrics across an entire application and application stack technologies, a differentiated capability of Stack Monitoring. Within Stack View, you can observe an application including its key underlying components and technology stack all together in one place.
	* Stack View provides specially curated key performance metrics for the health and performance of the entire application. Let's begin by adjusting the time frame from the **Last 60 Minutes** to **Last 24 Hours**. Now expand each tier. With each tier expanded, you get a complete view of the performance of your EBS application.
	* EBS admins typically have an idea of the time it takes for a request to complete, and which requests run long. You can hover over a data point and perform correlation across the charts on the page. Reviewing the **EBS tier** you can review the five worst programs by average running time and max running time. 
	* Within the **Concurrent Manager tier**, you can see once again the majority of requests complete successfully, while some complete with errors. From the Concurrent Manager tier you can also identify if there are any long active concurrent requests.

	![EBS Stack View, highlighting technology stack tiers](images/4-4-together.png " ")

	As EBS is a Java application, Stack Monitoring provides visibility into the performance of the WebLogic (WLS) cluster, specifically OACORE, the heart of EBS. Using the chart **JVM Memory Utilization** you can identify if WLS is starved for memory. In the screenshot below, we can see the utilization of both heap and non-heap memory has remained consistent. During that same time using the chart **Thread Pool Threads** we can see a couple drops in the number of idle connections. Reviewing **JDBC Connections** we can see there is no significant change in the number of threads in use and no threads waiting.

	![EBS Stack View, highlighting WebLogic Cluster oacore charts](images/4-5-together.png " ")

	Reviewing the **EBS Database tier**, you can review the number of transactions committed and rolled back. You can see a spike in wait times indicated in blue.
	
	Finally, you can review the health of the underlying hosts using the **Host tier**. In this screenshot you can see a spike in cpu and a small drop in memory.

	Reviewing the database tier in context with the host tier, we can see the transactions in the database dropped then immediately spiked. At the same time, the host CPU jumped and the memory utilization dropped. This is a great example of provide performance context across the application stack.

	![EBS Stack View, highlighting the database and host technology tiers](images/4-6-together.png " ")
	
	In this lab, you used a previously created alarm, **EBS Concurrent Manager Down in Last 60 Min DEMO** to determine if the Concurrent Manager had any impact to an EBS application completing jobs and if the Concurrent Manager down was attributed to any resource constraints. During the lab, you reviewed key performance metrics across an applications stack. You utilized Stack Monitoring's topology capability to navigate between resources to help triage the alert. Finally, you leveraged Stack View to review the performance of an entire application stack (EBS).

## Conclusion

Overall, you have learned how: 
* Stack Monitoring enables you to monitor the overall health of your applications and their underlying stack including servers, databases, and hosts. 
* Enterprise Summary can be used to immediately assess status and performance across each application stack tier, and its interactive design enables dynamic changes to any performance charts. 
* Resource home pages provide you with a curated view of the health and performance of resources through charts, tables, and Stack View. 
* Stack Monitoring can automatically provide an application topology automatically when discovering applications. 
	- The associations between resources further enables easy navigation up and down the application stack to ease and speed up the triaging and remediation of application performance issues. 
* And finally, the Stack View provides the ability to research the health and performance of the entire application stack from a single page to reduce incident times.
