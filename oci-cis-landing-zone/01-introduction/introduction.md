# Introduction to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Resource Manager

This set of labs will walk you through deploying a secure cloud architecture validated by Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.

Upon completion of the labs, a full set of OCI resources will be created as a base to build an enterprise workload.
