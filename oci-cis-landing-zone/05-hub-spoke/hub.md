# Lab 4: Create a DMZ Network

In this lab we are going to create a DMZ to protect applications in the Landing Zone from outside traffic. In Lab 4, we enabled the Hub & Spoke network option to create a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) that connects Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) together. Using this topology, we will restrict all traffic to and from the internet to use the DMZ. Within the DMZ, controls such as firewall devices can be implemented to filter harmful traffic.
