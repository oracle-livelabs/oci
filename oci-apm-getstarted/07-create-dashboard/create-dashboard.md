# Create a custom dashboard

## Introduction

In this lab, you will construct a custom dashboard, incorporating a custom Trace Table widget. This widget will be generated from a query that you run in the Trace Explorer, and be used for analysis and visualization.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

* Create a custom dashboard
* Add a widget to the dashboard
* Customize the Trace Table data widget
* Add a filter to the widget
* Import custom widget to the dashboard

### Prerequisites

* Completion of the preceding labs in this workshop

## Task 1: Define a custom query

To begin, you need to define the specific query for which you want to create a dashboard.

1. In the OCI console, from **Navigation Menu** > **Observability and Management** > **Trace Explorer** under **Application Performance Monitoring**.

2. **Trace Explorer** opens in the screen.
    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-1-1-te-landing-page.png " ")

3. Ensure the **Compartment** is set to **root/eStore/WineStore** and the **APM Domain** is set to **Prod**.

4. Type the following query in the query view.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	show spans * where kind = 'SERVER' group by serviceName, operationName
	</copy>
	```
    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-1-2-short-query.png " ")

      > **Note:** * (asterisk) in the query is used as a shortcut to display expected attributes. Optionally, you can enhance the query with more refined column titles: 
	     ***show spans OperationName as "Request name", avg(ApdexScore) as Apdex,count(\*) as Count, percent\_of\_items() as "% of Total Count", avg(SpanDuration) as "Avg Duration", sum(errorCount) as Errors where Kind='SERVER' group by OperationName,ServiceName order by count(\*) desc***
	   ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-1-3-enhanced-query.png " ")

5. Select and copy the text from the Query view, either by the CTRL+C or by right-clicking and selecting the **Copy** option from the context menu.

    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-1-4-copy-query.png " ")

## Task 2: Add a widget to a custom dashboard

1. From the **APM** menu at the top left corner, select **Dashboards**
    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-2-1-select-dashboard-menu.png " ")
2. This will open the **Dashboards** page.

      > **Note:** Once the dashboard is imported into the compartment, the following eight widgets will be available when creating or editing dashboards in that compartment.
	   * **CTDW Line chart** - Visualize a set of values over time as lines. Use the “first X rows” TQL clause to control the max number of lines
	   * **CTDW Compare metrics** - This chart accepts two independent TQLs, each returning one data series. It can be used to compare two metrics over time.
	   * **CTDW Bar chart** - Visualize a set of values over time as a stacked bar chart.
	   * **CTDW Traces over time** - Same as the above, configured specifically for Trace status presentation. It includes specific color settings for the four (Complete, Error, Incomplete, and Success) possible trace statuses.
	   * **CTDW Pie chart** - Displays a set of values as a donut. It accepts a second TQL for the value in the center of the donut.  
	   * **CTDW Apdex** - Same as the above, specifically configured for Apdex presentation, using Red, Yellow, and Green for frustrated, tolerating, and satisfied levels.
	   * **CTDW Single value** - A single value panel.
	   * **CTDW Gauge chart** - A circle gauge presentation of a single value. the max and min are provided by the TQL. These can be fixed values (as demonstrated in the default TQL) or calculated (e.g.: max(spanDuration) and min (spanDuration)). The widget has two parameters that can be used to set thresholds.

## Task 6: Add a custom widget using the Trace Data Widget Builder

 You can also create a widget based on the trace query. In this task, you will build a bubble chart widget, using Trace Data widget builder functionality. With this feature, you can transfer trace queries by copying and pasting from the Trace Explorer UI to the dashboard creation page.By saving the widget with a few additional configurations, your custom APM dashboard is ready within minutes. 
 

1. Open **Trace Explorer** from **Navigation Menu** > **Observability and Management** > **Trace Explorer** under **Application Performance Monitoring**.
    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-1-1-te-landing-page.png " ")
2. Type the following query in the query view, and hit **Run**.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	cluster by show spans spanduration first 1000 rows
	</copy>
	```

3. The results are displayed in the table view. The query executed the Cluster-by command, which organized data into clusters based on the span-duration metric. These clusters were generated according to the range of values, with additional columns such as count and percentage added to each cluster. Outliers were identified within the clusters.

    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-6-1-te-cluster.png " ")

 > **Note:** You can use Cluster By command in TQL to create clusters from the traces and spans, and identify the outlieres. For more information, see **[Cluster Trace data]( https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/work-queries-cluster.html#GUID-93E98932-ADB4-4A8C-9405-229C10A75E66)**.


4. Try an enhanced query that uses the Cluster-by command. Type the following query in the query view, and hit **Run**. The query result represents clusters of the top-server requests for a domain.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	cluster by show spans SpanDuration as Duration, ServiceName, OperationName as ServerRequest where kind='SERVER' and (ServiceName, OperationName) in (show spans serviceName,operationName where kind='SERVER'   group by serviceName,operationName order by sum(SpanDuration) first 8 rows) first 999999 rows
	</copy>
	```
    ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/7-6-2-te-enhanced-cluster.png " ")

	Next, you will bring this query to the dashboard creation page, and create a widget based on it.

5. From the menu, select **APM** > **Dashboards**.

    ![Oracle Cloud, APM menu](images/7-6-3-apmmenu-dashboards.png " ")

	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-5-8-right-click-edit.png " ")
8. In the **My new dashboard** editing page, from the **Compartment** filter, type **wine** to the select **root/eStore/WineStore**. Ensure the **APM Domain** is set to **Prod**. 
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-4-dashboard-edit.png " ")
9. From the **Widgets** tab, select **Add Widgets**. Click **+** icon, and select **Create query-based widget** from the pull-down menu.
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-5-select-querybased.png " ")
10. From the **Data source**, select **Traces**.
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-6-select-trace.png " ")
11. Copy the following query and paste it in the **Query** view. Hit **Run**.

	``` bash
	<copy>
	cluster by show spans SpanDuration as Duration, ServiceName, OperationName as ServerRequest where kind='SERVER' and (ServiceName, OperationName) in (show spans serviceName,operationName where kind='SERVER'   group by serviceName,operationName order by sum(SpanDuration) first 8 rows) first 999999 rows
	</copy>
	```

	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-7-add-query.png " ")
12. Verify the data populated in the table views. Click **Visualization** tab, select **Bubble Chart** from the **Chart Type** pull-down menu.
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-8-select-bubblechart.png " ")
13. In the **Visualization** tab, set the values of the fields as follows.

	* Chart type: **Bubble Chart**
	* X axis: **Duration_center**
	* Y axis: **Percentage**
	* Size: **Count**
	* Color by: **Server Request**
	* X axis title: **Duration (ms)**
	* Y axis title: **Percentage**
	* Legend: **Right**


	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-9-set-visualization.png " ")
14. Click the **About** tab, set the values of the fields as follows.

	* Name: **ServerRequest clustered by duration**
	* Compartment: **Select your lab compartment**
	* Description: **ServerRequest (operationName where kind=SERVER) clustered by duration.**

	Click **Save** to save the widget. 
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-10-set-about.png " ")

15. Click **Save Changes** to save your dashboard. 

	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-11-save-dashboard.png " ")

16. Verify that a new widget is saved in the dashboard. The chart represents the top-server requests of the selected APM domain. Clusters are displayed in bubble objects with different sizes.
	![Oracle Cloud, Dashboards page](images/7-6-12-verify-widget.png " ")
17. Hover mouse cursol on bubble objects to view the cluster information.
