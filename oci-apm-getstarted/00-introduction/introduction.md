# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Oracle Cloud APM to detect a performance issue from a cloud-native application, analyze the symptoms and identify the root cause. 

You will examine performance alarms on the APM Home dashboard, monitor activities with the pre-built performance widgets on the Synthetic Monitors dashboard, inspect client details in the HTTP Archive (HAR) file, and inspect server-side details using the APM Trace Explorer. Additionally, you will create complex personalized queries, save them for future use, and generate widgets to visually represent the data on a custom dashboard.


Estimated Time: 80 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Application Performance Management (OCI APM)

The diagram below provides an overview of the OCI APM Service, its features, components, and some of the other OCI services it integrates with.

Among other capabilities, OCI APM includes an implementation of a Distributed Tracing system. It collects and processes transaction trace data (spans) from the monitored application and makes it available for viewing, dashboarding, exploration, alerts, etc. For more information on APM and Trace Explorer please refer to Application Performance Monitoring > **[Use Trace Explorer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/use-trace-explorer.html)** section in the OCI Documentation.
