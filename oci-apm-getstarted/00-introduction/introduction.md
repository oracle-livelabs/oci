# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Oracle Cloud APM to analyze application data, identify symptoms, and trace issues down to their root causes in monitored GenAI and cloud-native applications.

You will begin by using the Inferencing App dashboard to analyze GenAI application data and drill down into trace details. You will also examine data captured for cloud-native service applications, including performance alarms, synthetic monitor activities, and server-side insights using the APM Trace Explorer. Additionally, you will learn how to create complex, personalized queries, save them for future use, and generate custom widgets to visually represent data on a personalized dashboard.


Estimated Time: 80 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Application Performance Management (OCI APM)

The diagram below provides an overview of the OCI APM Service, its features, components, and some of the other OCI services it integrates with.

  ![APM architecture](images/apm_diagram.png " ")

Among other capabilities, OCI APM includes an implementation of a Distributed Tracing system. It collects and processes transaction trace data (spans) from the monitored application and makes it available for viewing, dashboarding, exploration, alerts, etc. For more information on APM and Trace Explorer please refer to Application Performance Monitoring > **[Use Trace Explorer](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/doc/use-trace-explorer.html)** section in the OCI Documentation.
