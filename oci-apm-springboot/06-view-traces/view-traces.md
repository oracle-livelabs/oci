# View traces and spans in APM Trace Explorer

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the APM Trace Explorer to trace the workload generated with the WineCellar demo application.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.
[View traces and spans in APM Trace Explorer](videohub:1_ax6iqqu1)

### Objectives

*	Examine values in the span dimensions for the frontend browser and the backend Spring Boot server
* Use dimensions to automatically update the query and filter the selection

### Prerequisites

* Completion of preceding labs in this workshop.


## Task 1: Examine traces in APM Trace Explorer

1.  From the OCI menu, From the OCI menu, select **Observability & Management** > **Trace Explorer**

2.  On the Trace Explorer page, select **apmworkshop** for the **Compartment** and the **APM Domain**.

3.	By default, traces are displayed in the order by the start time. Right mouse click on the **Duration** column, select **Sort Descending** to show the traces by duration in descending order. This will bring the slowest trace to the top of the list.

4. Hover the mouse over the bar in the **Spans** column at the top row. Verify three services are included in the trace, and each color represents a service, wstore-back, wstore-front, and wstore-web, which you defined in the previous labs.

5.	Click the trace link at the **Service:Operationame** column.

   >**Note:** If you do not see a slow trace with a duration of 10 seconds or more, you can navigate the WineStore demo app a few times until you see the programmed slowness in the checkout service.

6. **Trace Details** page opens. Review the trace information on the upper screen. E.g., Status, Trace ID, Whether it has an error or not, how many spans and services are involved, or the duration of the trace.

7. In the **Topology** view, you can see how the operations are connected within the trace. Different colors indicate different services. Hover the mouse on the icons and the arrows that connect the icons. Review the information in the callouts.
  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-7-traceexplorer.png " ")

  In this example, it seems that the checkout service is where the most time was spent in the trace.

  >**Note:** The operations may look differently in the trace you selected.

8. Scroll down the page to show the **Spans** view. Spans in the trace are displayed in a Gantt chart. A span at the top of the list is the root span, and the child spans are nested below the root span.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-8-traceexplorer.png " ")

  In this example, one of the operations is taking 9 seconds alone, out of the total duration of 10 seconds. This seems to be the bottleneck of the slowness.

9. Click the operation name link.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-9-traceexplorer.png " ")

10. This opens a **Span Details** view. Review the span information, such as the operation name, which service it belongs to, start date and time, start time after the trace started, duration of the span, Trace ID, and Span ID.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-10-traceexplorer.png " ")

  From the operation name, this is a JDBC span that is generated by requesting a call to the database.

11. Scroll down and review the collected dimension values. In this example, there are 54 dimensions collected. E.g., App server, Host, Kubernetes, and performance information. In addition, it has database information, because this is a JDBC span.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-2-11-traceexplorer.png " ")

12. Click **Close** at the lower left corner of the window to close the **Span Details** view.

13. Click the **Trace Explorer** link from the breadcrumbs. This will bring you back to the Trace Explore the main view.

## Task 2: Filter traces with dimensions

1. Type '**apdex**' into the search field in the **Fields** section. Then click **ApdexLevel** from the list.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-3-1-traceexplorer.png " ")

2. **Dimension ApdexLevel Values** window opens. Apdex or Application Performance Index measures customer satisfaction based on applications' page or service performance. Review the values and counts. In this example, there are 10 frustrated traces, 69 satisfied traces, and 4 tolerating traces.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-3-2-traceexplorer.png " ")

  Select **frustrated** from the list, then click **Add to Query**.

3. Notice that the condition  **("ApdexLevel" = 'frustrated')** has been inserted to the query. Hit **Run**.

  ![Oracle Cloud, Trace Explorer](images/6-3-3-traceexplorer.png " ")

4. Traces view is refreshed and shows only traces **ApdexLevel** is frustrated.

## Conclusions

In this workshop, youâ€™ve learned how to use a file system by adding the APM Java agent to the microservices web application. You have also learned how to configure the APM Browser agent, and how to use APM Trace Explorer to view traces and spans. For more information on APM, refer to the OCI documentation, **[Application Performance Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/application-performance-monitoring/index.html)**.
