# Create and configure a file system

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a file system in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You will also create security rules to allow network traffic and mount the file system to the Kubernetes pods.  

***This lab requires OCI quota and permissions to create a file system in your tenancy. If you are using a FREE TRIAL, please go to the next Lab 4 (Free Trial): "Create and configure block volumes", which does not require a paid OCI quota.***

Estimated time: 15 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.
[Create and configure a file system](videohub:1_nuemqknc)

### Objectives

* Create a file system in the Oracle Cloud
*	Create security rules in the network
*	Create a YAML file, which defines Storage Class, Persistent Volume, and Persistent Volume Claim
*	Mount the volume to the Kubernetes cluster by applying the YAML, which recreates the Kubernetes pods with the new storage configuration

### Prerequisites

* OCI quota and permissions to create a file system and associated resources. See **[Creating File Systems](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/creatingfilesystems.htm)** and **[Service Limits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm#top)** in the Oracle Cloud documentation.
* Completion of the preceding labs in this workshop

## Task 1: Create a file system in the Oracle Cloud

1.  Minimize the Cloud Shell window by clicking the Minimize button.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, file systems](images/3-1-2-filesystem.png " ")

5. On the **Create File System** page, in the **File System Information** section, click **Edit Details**.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, file systems](images/3-1-3-filesystem.png " ")

6.	On the Create File System page, enter **apmlab-fss** into the **Name** field.

    Make sure the **apmworkshop** is selected in the **Compartment**. Leave the other fields in the section with default values.   
    ***Do NOT click the Create button yet.***

   ![Oracle Cloud console, file systems](images/3-1-4-filesystem.png " ")

7. Scroll down the **Create File System** page and find the **Export Information** section. Verify that the **Export Path** is set to **/apmlab-fss**. This is where the file system will be mounted. You will provision the APM Java agent at this location. In the **Mount Target Information** section, click **Edit Details** to expand the section.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, file systems](images/3-1-4-1-filesystem.png " ")

     *	Stateless: **No**
     *	Source Type: **CIDR**
     *	Source CIDR: **0.0.0.0/0**
     *	IP Protocol: **TCP**
     *	Source Port Range:  leave as default (All)
     *	Destination Port Range: **111,2048-2050** 	
     *	Description: **Ingress security rule for apmlab-fss**

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-6-securityrules.png " ")

6.	Click the **+ Another Ingress Rule** button and create an additional rule for **UDP**, with the destination port range **111,2048**. Use the same values with the rule created above for the rest of the fields.  

    Click the **Add Ingress Rules** button which creates 4 ingress rules in the security list.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-7-securityrules.png " ")

7.	After the configuration, your **Ingress Rules** have 4 additional security rules as in the image below.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-8-securityrules.png " ")

8.	Click **Egress Rules**, which is located on the left side of the screen.

    *	Destination Port Range: **111,2048-2050**
    *	Description: **Egress security rule for apmlab-fss**

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-11-securityrules.png " ")

11.	Click the **+ Another Egress Rule** button and create an additional rule for **UDP**, with the destination port **111**. Use the same values with the rule created above for the rest of the fields.<br><br> Click **Add Egress Rules** button which creates 3 egress rules in the security list.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-11-2-securityrules.png " ")

12.	After the configuration, your **Egress Rules** have 3 additional security rules as in the image below.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Security Rules](images/3-2-12-securityrules.png " ")

## Task 3: Mount the file system to Kubernetes pods

1. Click the **Developer tools** icon from the top right corner in the Oracle Cloud console menu bar, then select **Cloud shell** to start a Cloud Shell environment which will appear at the bottom of your page.
   ![Oracle Cloud console, Menu](images/3-3-1-menu.png " ")

    >	**Note:** If the Cloud Shell is already running but the window is minimized, you can restore the window by clicking the **Restore** icon on the toolbar.
      ![Oracle Cloud console, Menu](images/3-3-2-menu.png " ")


2.  If the previous Cloud Shell session is expired, run the oci ce (Container Engine) command that you saved in Lab 3, Task 2, step 5.


   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-2-cloudshell.png " ")

3.	Use any text editor (such as the vi editor tool) to open the **apmlab-fss.yaml** file for editing.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vi ~/sb-hol/apmlab-fss.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    >**Note:** If you are using the vi editor, type ***i*** to enter Insert mode, and make the text editable. Use allow keys to navigate the text and make changes to where you set the cursor. To save a file, press the Esc key, then type ***:wq*** to write and quit the file. If you do not wish a change, press Esc then type ***:q!*** to discard your changes. Please refer to the editor's references for more usage.
    Alternatively, you can use a built-in code editor to edit files. To use the code editor, select the **Developer tools** icon from the toolbar>  select **Code Editor**.
      ![yaml](images/3-3-2-1-yaml.png " ")

4. Review the file contents that create Kubernetes objects (StorageClass, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim) in your OKE. Replace the **mntTargetID** and **server IP** with the values copied in Lab 3, Task 1, step 11 in this Workshop. Save the change and close the file.

        apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
        kind: StorageClass
        metadata:
          name: apmlab-fss
        provisioner: oracle.com/apmlab-fss
        parameters:
          mntTargetId: <OCID of your Mount Target >
        ---
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolume
        metadata:
          name: apmlab-fsspv
        spec:
          storageClassName: apmlab-fss
          capacity:
            storage: 10Gi
          accessModes:
            - ReadWriteMany
          mountOptions:
            - nosuid
          nfs:
            server: <Server IP of your Mount Target>
            path: "/apmlab-fss"
            readOnly: false
        ---
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        metadata:
          name: apmlab-fsspv
        spec:
          storageClassName: apmlab-fss
          accessModes:
          - ReadWriteMany
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 10Gi
          volumeName: apmlab-fsspv

     >**Note:** Refer to the screenshot image below to see what it should look like after the file is modified. Verify that the Kubernetes objects, such as StorageClass, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClass are configured in the YAML file.
       	![yaml](images/3-3-2-yaml.png " ")


## Task 4: Apply changes to the container

1.	Execute the following command to add the storage objects to the Kubernetes cluster.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/apmlab-fss.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
2. Verify the Storage Class, PV and PVC are created.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-3-cloudshell.png " ")

     >**Note:** If you need to modify the YAML file after once applied, first run the command below to remove the objects, modify the file, then rerun the above command to re-apply the YAML.  
     kubectl delete -f ~/sb-hol/apmlab-fss.yaml

## Task 5: Add volumes to Kubernetes pods

1.	Next, you will need to map the PV to the pods. Open **wstore.yaml** file with an editor.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vi ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

2. Scroll down the file. You will see there are two statefulsets, **wstore-front** and **wstore-back**, defined in the YAML file.

3. Within each statefulset, find a line that defines the container port: "**- containerPort: 8080**" (line 51 and line 75).

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-3-1-cloudshell.png " ")

4. Hit **i** to enter the edit mode. Carefully insert the following code below the **containerPort**. Note that the same changes have to be made in both statefulsets, **wstore-back** and **wstore-front**.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

                volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: "/apmlab-fss"
                  name: apmlab-nfs
              volumes:
              - name: apmlab-nfs
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: apmlab-fsspv



    > ***Suggested Editing Tips:***
     - Use your mouse to select the text above, and manually copy and paste it into a text file.
     - Auto copy is not provided as it may break the indentation.
     - Copy the entire area from the text box, including the space preceding the text.
     - In the yaml file, place your mouse cursor at the beginning of the line, then paste the code.
     - Make sure to keep the same space indentation when pasting the code into the file.
     - "VolumeMounts:" aligns with "ports:"
     - "Volumes:" aligns with "imagePullSecrets:"
     - Refer to the screenshot image below to see how it should look, after the file is modified.
     ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-3-2-cloudshell.png " ")
     - Also refer to the below code change made to one of the statefulsets, **wstore-back**.

         apiVersion: apps/v1
         kind: StatefulSet
         metadata:
           name: wstore-back
         spec:
           serviceName: "wstore-backend"
           replicas: 2
           selector:
             matchLabels:
               app: wstore-back
           template:
             metadata:
               labels:
                 app: wstore-back
             spec:
               containers:
               - name: wstore
                 image: iad.ocir.io/axfo51x8x2ap/p-winestore:latest
                 command: ["java", "-jar", "./wineStore.jar", "--spring.config.location=file:/spring/wstore.properties"]
                 ports:
                 - containerPort: 8080
                 volumeMounts:
                 - mountPath: "/apmlab-fss"
                   name: apmlab-nfs
               volumes:
               - name: apmlab-nfs
                 persistentVolumeClaim:
                   claimName: apmlab-fsspv
               imagePullSecrets:
                   - name: ocirsecret



5.	Run the following command. This will recreate the pods, with the new object configurations.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml --validate=false
    </copy>
    ```
    Verify that the service for wstore-frontend and both statefulsets are configured.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-6-cloudshell.png " ")


6.	Run the following command to ensure the pods are in the running state. Verify the **AGE** column to ensure the pods are restarted.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-7-cloudshell.png " ")


7. ***Troubleshooting:*** If the pods do not come back with the running state in a minute or two, review the configuration in the file to make sure they have the right indentation. For learning purposes, we have preconfigured the volume mapping in the **wstore-add-storage.yaml** file. Run the following command to view what it looks like after the successful file editing.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vi ~/sb-hol/wstore-add-storage.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    > If the problem persists, optionally, you can run the preconfigured YAML file to regenerate the file with the volume mapping.
     - First, run the following command to delete the failing configurations:  
        kubectl delete -f ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml  
     - Then run the following to apply the preconfigured settings:    
        kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/wstore-add-storage.yaml --validate=false



8.	Execute the following command to access the Kubernetes pods.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
     kubectl exec -it wstore-front-0 -- bash -c "cd / && ls "
    </copy>
    ```

    Make sure that you see the ***apmlab-fss*** directory that is the file system mounted to this location.

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-3-8-cloudshell.png " ")


    >***Debugging TIPS***: If you cannot find the apmlab-fss directory, or the pods do not start running, execute the following command from the Cloud Shell to troubleshoot.   
    kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

You may now **proceed to Lab 5 (Paid Tenancy): Instrument server monitoring on the file system**.
