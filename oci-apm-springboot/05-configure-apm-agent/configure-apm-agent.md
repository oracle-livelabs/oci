# Instrument the server monitoring on the file system

## Introduction

In this lab, you will download the APM Java Agent installer file from the Oracle Cloud console, upload it to the Oracle Cloud shell, transfer it to the Kubernetes container, provision the Java Agent to the file system, and finally, deploy the Agent to the Kubernetes pods.

***Please run this lab only if you completed Lab 4 (Paid Tenancy): "Create and configure a file system".***

***For users who completed  Lab 4 (Free Trial): "Create and configure block volumes", please go to the next lab, Lab 5 (Free Trial): "Instrument server monitoring for block volumes".***

This lab requires OCI quota and permissions to create a file system in your tenancy. If you are using a FREE TRIAL, please go to the next Lab 4 (Free Trial): Create and configure block volumes, which does not require a paid OCI quota.***


Estimated time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 2: Download the APM Java Agent to the Cloud shell

1.  Type the following command into the Cloud Shell. Make sure to ***replace*** the **Agent version** with the copied text from the previous steps.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    cd ~/; wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/oracle/apm/agent/java/apm-java-agent-installer/<Agent version>/apm-java-agent-installer-<Agent version>.jar
    </copy>
    ```

    E.g., cd ~/; wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/oracle/apm/agent/java/apm-java-agent-installer/1.8.3326/apm-java-agent-installer-1.8.3326.jar


2.	Hit the enter key and verify the message to ensure the successful file transfer.

3.  Type the ls command. Confirm that the java agent file installer is in the home directory.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ls ~
    </copy>
    ```
   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-1-6-cloudshell.png " ")

## Task 3: Copy the Java Agent installer to the file system

1.	Run the command below to copy the Java Agent installer file to the file system. Ensure to ***replace*** the **apm-agent-version** with that of the APM Java Agent you have, before the command execution.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl cp apm-java-agent-installer-<apm-agent-version>.jar wstore-front-0:/apmlab-fss/
    </copy>
    ```

    > - e.g., kubectl cp apm-java-agent-installer-1.8.3326.jar wstore-front-0:/apmlab-fss/  
    - The command copies the Agent installer to the **wstore-front**, but it can be copied to any pod as the way we set up, all pods share the same file system.


2.	Use the kubectl command below to remotely run the ls command in the container in the Kubernetes pod.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl exec -it wstore-front-0 -- bash -c "cd /apmlab-fss && ls "
    </copy>
    ```

    If you see the java agent installer file in the location, the file transfer was successful.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-1-8-cloudshell.png " ")

    >**Note:** The APM version may be different from what is shown in the example.

## Task 4: Provision of the APM Java Agent


1.	Execute the command below to provision the APM Java agent. ***Replace*** the **APM Domain Private key** and **APM Domain Endpoint**, with the values saved in Lab2, Task2. Please also ***change*** the **apm-agent-version** in the file name to the version of the agent you have.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl exec -it wstore-front-0 -- bash -c "cd /apmlab-fss && java -jar ./apm-java-agent-installer-<apm-agent-version>.jar provision-agent -service-name=WS-svc -destination=.  -private-data-key=<APM Domain Private Key> -data-upload-endpoint=<APM Domain Endpoint>"
    </copy>
    ```
    E.g., kubectl exec -it wstore-front-0 -- bash -c "cd /apmlab-fss && java -jar apm-java-agent-installer-1.8.3326.jar provision-agent -service-name=WS-svc -destination=. -private-data-key=ABCDEFG12345ABCDEF123456ABCDE -data-upload-endpoint=https://abcdefgt12345aaaaaaaaabcdef.apm-agt.us-phoenix-1.oci.oraclecloud.com"

    With a successful installation, you should see the output similar to below.

   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-1-10-cloudshell.png " ")

2.	Execute the below command to verify ***oracle-apm-agent*** directory is created under the apmlab-fss directory.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl exec -it wstore-front-0 -- bash -c "cd /apmlab-fss && ls "
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-1-11-cloudshell.png " ")

## Task 5: Deploy the Java Agent

The next step is to deploy the Java Agent. First, update the **wstore.yaml** file by adding the java runtime argument that points to the APM Agent jar file bootstrap location, then apply to the Kubernetes pods. Notice that the service names, **wstore-front** and **wstore-back**, that are used to display in the APM Trace Explorer, are also added to the command for the statefulsets.

1.  Use any editor to open the wstore.yaml file.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vi ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
2. Find the following line in each statefulset, where Java runtime arguments are set. (Look for lines 49 and 80, assuming the volumes were added as expected in the previous steps).

    >command: ["java", "-jar", "./wineStore.jar", "--spring.config.location=file:/spring/wstore.properties"]


3. Hit **i**. Locate line 49, then insert the following arguments after the **command: ["java",**.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
     "-javaagent:/apmlab-fss/oracle-apm-agent/bootstrap/ApmAgent.jar", "-Dcom.oracle.apm.agent.service.name=wstore-front",
    </copy>
    ```

4. Next, locate line 80, and insert the following arguments after the **command: ["java",**.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
     "-javaagent:/apmlab-fss/oracle-apm-agent/bootstrap/ApmAgent.jar", "-Dcom.oracle.apm.agent.service.name=wstore-back",
    </copy>
    ```
    The image below shows the **wstore-back** statefulset after the successful editing, for example. Please note that you will need to add the arguments to both statefulsets, **wstore-front** and **wstore-back**, and the service names have to be configured differently.

  ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-6-1-cloudshell.png " ")    


    > ***Troubleshooting***: For learning purposes, we have preconfigured the java argument editing in the **wstore-deploy-agent.yaml** file. If you encounter any issues run the following command to review how the changes are expected to be done.
    - vi ~/sb-hol/wstore-deploy-agent.yaml


5.	Recreate the Kubernetes pods by applying the **wstore-deploy-agent.yaml** file.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/wstore.yaml --validate=false
    </copy>
    ```

    Verify the service and the statefulsets are configured.

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-6-2-cloudshell.png " ")    

6.	Run the following command to check the status of the pods. Make sure they are in the Running state and Ready. If the status is pending, re-run the command. If they do not come back after a few minutes, review the file to ensure the editing was done correctly.  

    ```bash
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods
    </copy>
    ```
    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell ](images/4-6-3-cloudshell.png " ")

    Once the pods are in the Running state, the APM Java Agent is active and listening to the WineCellar application. It captures backend traces and spans which you can view in the APM Trace Explorer.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
