# Instrument the server monitoring with OpenTelemetry Operator

## Introduction

In this lab, you will instrument the application using the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Operator, which automatically inject and configure APM Java Agent to the Kubernetes cluster.

The OCI APM Java agent is designed to monitor Java applications and supports multiple deployment options across Kubernetes and other environments. The latest addition to these options is the OTEL operator, a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the automatic injection of Java agents into JVMs running in Kubernetes Pods.

You will also enable automatic APM Browser agent injection, which captures traces and spans generated by the browser, as part of the custom resource configuration.

Estimated time: 5 minutes


### Objectives

* Install cert-manager and the OpenTelemetry Operator.
* Use Kubernetes custom resources and annotations to deploy the APM agent to the cluster.
* Enable APM Browser Agent injection for real-time user session monitoring.



### Prerequisites

* Completion of the preceding labs in this workshop

## Task 1: Install cert-manager and OpenTelemetry Operator

As a pre-requisite to automatically deploy APM Java agent in the Kubernetes, cert-manager and OpenTelemetry Operator must to be installed.

1. Run the command below to install cert-manager.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f  https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.2/cert-manager.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/1-1-cert-manager.png " ")

2. Once the command is complete, wait for 20 seconds to complete the configurations in the background. Then install the **[OpenTelemetry Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator)** into the Kubernetes cluster by running the command below. 

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl apply -f  https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
    </copy>
    ```
   
   ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/1-2-otel-operator.png " ")
 
 >**Note:** if you see an error, **no endpoints available for service "cert-manager-webhook"**, re-run the command to install OpenTelemetry Operator.

## Task 2: Create Kubernetes custom resource definition

To manage automatic instrumentation, the operator must have information about the agent and its configuration.

The first requirement is addressed using a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). The Custom Resource will be used by the operator to copy the agent into the pod with required configuration. The OpenTelemetry operator uses Kubernetes annotations to determine which pods should be automatically injected with the OCI APM Java agent. 

In the custom resource, you can add parameters to enable APM Browser Agent Injection. This configures the APM Java Agent to automatically inject the browser agent, enabling real-time user session monitoring for the application.



1. To create a custom resource definition, use text editor (such as the vi editor tool) to create a configuration file within the workshop directory.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
     vi ~/sb-hol/customapmresource.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

2. Copy the content below and paste it into the configuration file. Replace **Data Upload Endpoint**, **Private Data key** and the **Public Data key** (copied from the APM domain administration page in the previous labs) and save the file.


    ``` bash
    <copy>  
    apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Instrumentation
    metadata:
      name: inst-apm-java
      namespace: opentelemetry-operator-system
    spec:
      java:
        image: container-registry.oracle.com/oci_observability_management/oci-apm-java-agent:latest
        env:
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_data_upload_endpoint
            value: <DATA UPLOAD END POINT>
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_private_data_key
            value: <PRIVATE DATA KEY>
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_public_data_key
            value: <PUBLIC DATA KEY>
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_rum_enable_injection
            value: "true"
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_rum_service_name
            value: wstore-web
          - name: OTEL_com_oracle_apm_agent_rum_web_application
            value: "Wstore WebApp"
   
    </copy>
    ```
  ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-1-create-cr.png " ")

    3. Execute the command below to create a custom resource to the cluster.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
     kubectl apply -f ~/sb-hol/customapmresource.yaml
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/2-2-apply-cr.png " ")

 >**Note:** You can ignore the warning. 

## Task 3: Add an annotation to the namespace

Another requirement to manage automatic instrumentation is to specify which pods should be instrumented. This is handed by special annotations. Annotations can be added to a namespace to inject all pods within that namespace. Alternatively, annotations can be applied to individual PodSpec objects, such as those in Deployment, StatefulSet, and other resources. In this lab, annotation is applied to the entire namespace for the learning purposes.

1. Open the namespace to edit.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl edit namespace default
    </copy>
    ```
 Copy the below lines below and insert them as shown in the example image. Ensure the indentation matches the level of the "labels:" key.
    ``` bash
    <copy>
    annotations:
      instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "opentelemetry-operator-system/inst-apm-java"
    </copy>
    ```
     ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/3-1-annotation.png " ")

## Task 4: Redeploy the application

1.  Run the command below to restart the stafulsets. This will redeploy the application.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset 
    </copy>
    ```

     ![Oracle Cloud console, Cloud Shell](images/4-1-restart-app.png " ")
    

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
