Lab 7: Configure OCI Events
===

OCI Events tracks resource changes with events which comply with CNCF CloudEvents Standard. 

## 1. Create an *Event* Rule

Go to Events Service → Rules → Create Rule, and create a rule as shown in the screenshot below. 

![](./images/Set-Ev1.png)

   * For Event Type, select **Object Storage**, then select  **Object - Create** and **Object - Update**.
   * For Attribute, select **bucketName**. Attribute Values should be **training-data-bucket** and **inferencing-data-bucket**, which were the values set up in **Lab 3** earlier.
   * Under Actions, select **Functions** for Action Type, and select the right *Function Compartment*, *Function Application* and *Function Name* provisioned in **Lab 6**.

   The finalized Rule Logic is shown below:

   ```java
   MATCH event WHERE (
     eventType EQUALS ANY OF (
       com.oraclecloud.objectstorage.updateobject,
       com.oraclecloud.objectstorage.createobject
     )
     AND (
       bucketName MATCHES ANY OF (
         training-data-bucket,
         inferencing-data-bucket
       )
     )
   )
   ```

   For reference, a sample event generated by object upload is shown below.

   ```java
   {
     "eventType" : "com.oraclecloud.objectstorage.updateobject",
     "cloudEventsVersion" : "0.1",
     "eventTypeVersion" : "2.0",
     "source" : "ObjectStorage",
     "eventTime" : "2022-08-24T18:45:39Z",
     "contentType" : "application/json",
     "data" : {
       "compartmentId" : "<compartment_ocid>",
       "compartmentName" : "<compartment_name>",
       "resourceName" : "<dataset_name>",
       "resourceId" : "<resource_id>",
       "availabilityDomain" : "PHX-AD-1",
       "additionalDetails" : {
         "bucketName" : "<bucket_name>",
         "versionId" : "<version_id>",
         "archivalState" : "Available",
         "namespace" : "<namespace>",
         "bucketId" : "<bucket_ocid>",
         "eTag" : "<etag>"
       }
     },
     "eventID" : "<event_id>",
     "extensions" : {
       "compartmentId" : "<compartment_id>"
     }
   }
   ```

## 2. Enable OCI Event Logs

Enable Event Logs for troubleshooting purposes as shown in the screenshot below.
