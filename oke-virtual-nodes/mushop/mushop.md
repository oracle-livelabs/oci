# Deploy a sample eCommerce application (MuShop) to the cluster

## Introduction

There are four options for deploying MuShop. They range from manual (docker), automated (Helm) to fully automated (Terraform).

Designing in microservices offers excellent separation concerns and provides developer independence.  While these benefits are clear, they can often introduce some complexity for the development environment.  Services support configurations that offer flexibility, when necessary, and establish parity as much as possible.  It is essential to use the same tools for development to production.

*Note: This diagram contains services not covered by these labs.*

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Download Source Code
* Deploy MuShop to the OKE Virtual Nodes Cluster
* Expose your app publicly

### Prerequisites

* Completed the [Provisioning](../provision/provision.md) lab
* Completed the [Setup](../setup/setup.md) lab

## Task 1: Obtain MuShop source code

1. Open up Cloud Shell and clone the github repo.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative.git mushop
    </copy>
    ````

    Sample response:

    ````shell
    Cloning into 'mushop'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 542, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (542/542), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (313/313), done.
    remote: Total 15949 (delta 288), reused 424 (delta 200), pack-reused 15407
    Receiving objects: 100% (15949/15949), 17.59 MiB | 33.71 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (9557/9557), done.
    ````

1. Change to the mushop directory

    ````shell
    <copy>
    cd mushop
    </copy>
    ````

    ![MuShop Tree](images/mushop-code.png)

    *./deploy:* Collection of application deployment resources
    *./src:* MuShop individual service code, Dockerfile, etc

1. Check **kubectl** context

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl config current-context
    </copy>
    ````

    Sample response:

    ````shell
    cluster-c4daylfgvrg
    ````

## Task 2: Deploy the eCommerce App with Helm

Remembering that helm provides a way of packaging and deploying configurable charts, next we will deploy the application in "mock mode" where cloud services are mocked, yet the application is fully functional

1. Deploy the application in "mock mode" where cloud services are mocked, yet the application is fully functional

    ````shell
    <copy>
    helm install mushop ./deploy/complete/helm-chart/mushop -f ./deploy/complete/helm-chart/mushop/values-virtual-nodes.yaml
    </copy>
    ````

1. Please be patient. It may take a few moments to download all the application images.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods --watch
    </copy>
    ````

    *Note:* To leave the _watch_ press `CTRL-C` anytime. If do not want to keep watching and just see the current list of PODS, just use `kubectl get pods`

1. Find the EXTERNAL-IP assigned to the edge microservice.  Open the IP address in your browser.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl get svc edge
    </copy>
    ````

1. Open to the MuShop Storefront by using your browser connecting to http://< EXTERNAL-IP >

## Task 3: Explore the deployed app

When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the container image for your application and the number of replicas that you want to run.

Kubernetes created a Pod to host your application instance. A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker), and some shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:

* Shared storage, as Volumes
* Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
* Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

The most common operations can be done with the following kubectl commands:

* **kubectl get** - list resources
* **kubectl describe** - show detailed information about a resource
* **kubectl logs** - print the logs from a container in a pod
* **kubectl exec** - execute a command on a container in a pod

You can use these commands to see when applications were deployed, what their current statuses are, where they are running and what their configurations are.

1. Check the microservices deployments for MuShop

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl get deployments
    </copy>
    ````

1. Check the pods deployed

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl get pods
    </copy>
    ````

1. Get the last created pod to inspect

    ````shell
    <copy>
    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'|awk '{print $1}'|tail -n 1) && \
    echo Using Pod: $POD_NAME
    </copy>
    ````

1. View what containers are inside that Pod and what images are used to build those containers

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl describe pod $POD_NAME
    </copy>
    ````

1. Anything that the application would normally send to `STDOUT` becomes logs for the container within the Pod. We can retrieve these logs using the `kubectl logs` command:

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl logs $POD_NAME
    </copy>
    ````

1. Execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and running.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl exec $POD_NAME env
    </copy>
    ````

1. List the content of the Podâ€™s container work folder:

    ````shell
    <copy>
    kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME ls
    </copy>
    ````

    *Note:* You can also start a `bash` session on the Pod's container, just change the `ls` to `bash`. Remember that you need to type `exit` to exit the bash session.

## Task 4: Under the Hood

1. To get a better look at all the installed Kubernetes manifests by using the template command.

    ````shell
    <copy>
    mkdir ./out
    <copy>
    ````

    ````shell
    <copy>
    helm template mushop ./deploy/complete/helm-chart/mushop -f ./deploy/complete/helm-chart/mushop/values-virtual-nodes.yaml --output-dir ./out
    <copy>
    ````

1. Explore the files, and see each output.
