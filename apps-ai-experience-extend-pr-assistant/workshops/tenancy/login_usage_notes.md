When creating agents and teams in Fusion AI Agent Studio, all components must have a unique name.

To ensure your components have a unique name, please use an initial code when naming your components.

Take the first two letters of your first name and last two letters of your last name to form a unique code.  If this spells out a common word, add a number.

> **EXAMPLE:**<br/>
> ***TI***M SULLIV***AN*** = ***TIAN***<br/>
> ***CO***RY WA***DE*** = ***CODE2***

Once you have chosen a code, use it consistently to ensure you can easily find your components.
