# Developer Persona and Proper Credentials Management with OCI Vault

## Introduction

In Lab 3, return as a developer persona to discover the secure realm of OCI Vault. Learn the importance of proper credentials management as we guide you through leveraging OCI Vault to securely store and access credentials, ensuring a robust and resilient approach to security.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault is a management service that stores and manages master encryption keys and secrets for secure access to resources.

The below video gives an overview of OCI key management service and its key concepts.

By utilizing OCI Vault, you can effectively manage and control access to secrets within your OCI environment. The Vault service offers robust security features, including encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, auditing capabilities, and integration with other OCI services.

Estimated Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Learn the importance of secure credential management in OCI.
- Utilize OCI Vault to securely store and manage credentials.
- Understand the proper workflow of accessing credentials from OCI Vault and applying them to interact with REST APIs.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Some understanding of cloud terms
- Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OCI would be helpful.

## Task 1: Create a Compartment

A compartment is a logical container to organize and control access to OCI resources. In our case we need a compartment for our Compute instance Vault. If you already have a Compartment feel free to skip to the next section. Use the following steps to create a compartment.

1. Login to the OCI Console as an Administrator
2. Go to Menu > Identity > Compartments
   ![Console Menu](../setup-oci-vault/images/compartment-creation-image-1.png "Console Menu")
3. Click the Create Compartment button
4. Enter the following:
    - Name: `my-compartment`
    - Description: `My Compartment`
    - Select a Parent Compartment
5. Click Create Compartment
    ![Create Compartment Form](../setup-oci-vault/images/compartment-creation-image-2.png "Create Compartment Form")
6. Go into the new Compartment and copy the OCID; this will be used next.

## Task 2: Create a Dynamic Group

A Dynamic Group is a group that dynamically grant access to resources based on a rule. Our Dynamic Group will be used with a matching rule to determine which instances we want to allow API calls against the service we are going to use.

Use the following steps to create a dynamic group.

1. Login to the OCI Console
2. Go to Menu > Identity & Security > Dynamic Groups
3. Click the Create Dynamic Group button
    ![Console Menu](../setup-oci-vault/images/dynamic-group-image-1.png "Console Menu")
4. Enter the following:
    - Name: `my-secret-group`
    - Description: `My Secret Dynamic Group`
    - Rule: `any {instance.compartment.id = '<ocid_compartment>'}`
    - NOTE: Where `<ocid_compartment>` is the ocid of the target compartment.
5. Click the Create Dynamic Group button to save
    ![Create Dynamic Group](../setup-oci-vault/images/dynamic-group-image-2.png "Create Dynamic Group")

## Task 3: Create a Vault

We will now create a Vault in the target compartment, then add a key that will be used to encrypt a new secret. The secret could be anything, but for our example we will store a API-token. Note that you could add multiple secrets if needed. Using the following steps to create a vault, a key, and a secret.

1. Login to the OCI Console
2. Go to Menu > Identity & Security > Vault
    ![Console Menu](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-1.png "Console Menu")
3. Select the target compartment
4. Click the Create Vault button
5. Enter the following:
    - Name:  `my-vault`
6. Click Create Vault button to save
    ![Create Vault Form](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-2.png "Create Vault Form")
7. Click on the `my-vault` that was just created
8. Click on the Keys link under Resources
    ![Details of Vault](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-3.png "Details of Vault")
9. Click Create Key button
10. Enter a Name for the key (e.g. `my-vault-key`)
11. Select 256 bits from the Key Shape
12. Click Create Key button to save
    ![Create Key Form](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-4.png "Create Key Form")
13. Click on the Secrets link under Resources
14. Click Create Secret button
15. Enter the following:
      - Name: `my-secret`
      - Description: `My Secret`
      - Encryption Key: select `my-vault-key` created earlier
      - Secret Contents: `<my secret here>`
16. Click Create Secret button
    ![Create Secret Interface](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-5.png "Create Secret Interface")
17. Click on the secret `my-secret`
    ![Create Secret Form](../setup-oci-vault/images/vault-image-6.png "Create Secret Form")
18. Copy the secret OCID to be used next.

## Task 4: Create a Policy using the Dynamic Group

After you have created a dynamic group, you need to create policy to permit the dynamic groups to access OCI services.

The below policy statement allows all instances in the dynamic group `my-secret-group` to access the secret `my-secret`.

> **Note**: Better policy to only access a specific secret

``` txt
<copy> allow dynamic-group my-secret-group to read secret-family in compartment my-compartment where target.secret.name = 'my-secret' </copy>
```

Use the following steps to create a the policy:

1. Login to the OCI Console
2. Go to Menu > Identity & Security> Policies
    ![Console Menu](../setup-oci-vault/images/policy-image-1.png "Console Menu")
3. Click the Create Policy button
    ![Create Policy Interface](../setup-oci-vault/images/policy-image-2.png "Create Policy Interface")
4. Enter the following:
    - Name: `my-secret-policy`
    - Description: `My Secret Policy`
    - Statements :
        - `allow dynamic-group my-secret-group to read secret-family in compartment my-compartment where target.secret.name = 'my-secret'`
5. Click the Create button to save
    ![Create Policy Form](../setup-oci-vault/images/policy-image-3.png "Create Policy Form")

## Task 5: Retrieve the secret from the Compute Instance

Finally, we can create a script to retrieve our secret. The following steps creates a Python script that you can use as a framework to build on, but this could also be done in other languages that are supported such as Java, Ruby, and Go â€” [Software Development Kits and Command Line Interface](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm). Use the following steps to create a Python script with the given example.

1. Login to the OCI Console
2. Go to Menu > Computes > Instances
    ![Console Menu](../setup-oci-vault/images/instance-image-1.png "Console Menu")
3. Select the correct compartment
4. Copy the public IP
    ![Access Instance Public IP](../setup-oci-vault/images/instance-image-2.png "Access Instance Public IP")
5. Open a Shell session and run the below command

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ssh opc@<instance-public-ip>
    </copy>
    ```

6. Create a file.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    vim get-secret.py
    </copy>
    ```

7. Press `i` and paste in the following Python script.

    ``` python
    <copy>
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    # coding: utf-8
    # COPYRIGHT (c) 2024 ORACLE

    import oci
    import base64
    import sys

    # Replace secret_id value below with the ocid of your secret
    secret_id = "ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1.<my_secret_ocid>"

    # By default this will hit the auth service in the region the instance is running.
    signer = oci.auth.signers.InstancePrincipalsSecurityTokenSigner()

    # In the base case, configuration does not need to be provided as the region and tenancy are obtained from the InstancePrincipalsSecurityTokenSigner
    identity_client = oci.identity.IdentityClient(config={}, signer=signer)

    # Get instance principal context
    secret_client = oci.secrets.SecretsClient(config={}, signer=signer)

    # Retrieve secret
    def read_secret_value(secret_client, secret_id):
        response = secret_client.get_secret_bundle(secret_id)
        base64_Secret_content = response.data.secret_bundle_content.content
        base64_secret_bytes = base64_Secret_content.encode('ascii')
        base64_message_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_secret_bytes)
        secret_content = base64_message_bytes.decode('ascii')
        return secret_content

    # Print secret
    secret_contents = read_secret_value(secret_client, secret_id)
    print(format(secret_contents))
    </copy>
    ```

8. Be sure to change the `secret_id` ocid in the `get-secret.py` script with your secret, then save and exit.
9. Make the `get-secret.py` script executable.

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    chmod +x get-secret.py
    </copy>
    ```

10. Run the following command to magically return the secret.  

    ``` bash
    <copy>
    ./get-secret.py

    <my secret here>
    </copy>
    ```
