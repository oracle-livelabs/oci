### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Oracle offers two types of Cloud Accounts:

- Free Tier Accounts: After you sign up for the free [Oracle Cloud promotion](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/network-firewall/home.htm) or sign up for a paid account, youâ€™ll get a welcome email. The email provides you with your cloud account details and sign in credentials.

- Oracle Cloud Paid Accounts: When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends an email to the default administrator at your company with the sign-in credentials and URL. This administrator can then create a user for each person who needs access to the Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.

**Note**: Either account type can be used to facilitate the exercises within the hands-on-lab.

### Objectives
