# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Estimated Time: 3 - 5 hours

OCI Network Firewall is a next-generation managed network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure virtual cloud network (VCN), powered by Palo Alto NetworksÂ®. [Visit our documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/network-firewall/home.htm) for more information on the Network Firewall service. We will explore various, common, use-cases and look into step-by-step guides on implementing each one of them.

To gain more familiarity with Oracle Cloud's networking concepts, I would recommend watching our introductory [Oracle Cloud Networking YouTube series](https://youtu.be/mIYSgeX5FkM) as well as the [Oracle Cloud Networking Overview Documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm) to become more familiar with Oracle Cloud's networking components and their relationships.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Deploy a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN), Subnets, Route tables, Security Lists.
* Deploy OCI Network Firewalls and use different configuration items in the Firewall Security Policy.
* Adjust routing inside the OCI VCN so we introduce a Network Firewall on the path.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Administrative Oracle Cloud Access to provision networking and compute resources.
* Basic knowledge of OCI Networking components and networking, in general.

### Workflow

This Workshop contains six LABs, each with their own dedicated tasks. Any LAB relies on constructs deployed in previous LABs so **do not skip** any LAB or task or you will not get the intended result.
