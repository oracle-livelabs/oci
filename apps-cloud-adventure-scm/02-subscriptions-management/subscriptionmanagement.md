## Summary

Subscription Management is a critical supply chain process that drives recurring revenue and higher customer service levels. Oracle Subscription Management provides a complete solution to sell subscriptions, services, and usage-based products that include tangible items, such as periodic copier ink delivery, or intangible items, such as complex usage-based software subscriptions.  Charge your customers based on how much they consume, with usage collected from any source via a web service.  Increase customer lifetime value by improving renewal rates and reducing revenue leakage with the renewal capabilities in Oracle Subscription Management.

In this example, we used Oracle Subscription Management to serve a customer by checking what assets are covered and what they entitlements they have on their warranty.  

In this example, we used Oracle Warehouse Management’s embedded Mobile App to look up item information.
