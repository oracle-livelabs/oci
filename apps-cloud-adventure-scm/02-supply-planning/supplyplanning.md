This is a fresh and unique way to offer you a chance for hands-on experience of highly differentiated and specifically curated content of numerous vignettes that are typically encountered Supply Chain Management. We hope you will enjoy today’s adventure exploring a complete and unified solution for the office of the COO.

As you follow along, do not forget to answer the Adventure Check Point questions! 


Estimated Time: 6 minutes


### Objectives

In this activity, you will:
* Use Oracle Supply Planning’s “Planning Advisor” to review Purchasing Lead Time Variances and gain Insights into supplier performance based on historical shipments. The system makes recommendations for Lead Time updates, which can be added to simulation sets for a What-If scenario analysis before accepting the recommendations and making changes accordingly.  


 


## Task 1: ESG Dashboards and Analytics

1. You recently noticed your suppliers do not always ship according to their provided Lead Times. 

    Let’s review the AI recommendations for Lead Time updates based on historical deliveries.

    > Click on the **Supply Chain Planning** tab and select the **Supply Planning** App.

2. SUPPLY PLANNING allows you to plan and manage material and capacity across your plants, distribution centers, suppliers, and contract manufacturer partners in discrete, process, and project-based manufacturing operations.

    > Click **Planning Advisor** to review the system alert.

3. Planning Advisor alerts about deviations of purchases items from their planned lead times and provides deeper insights into variance performance at an item level for all suppliers

    > Click on **Purchase Lead Time Variance** in the pop-up window.

4. Displayed is a graphical summary of the lead time variances in a Treemap view which show the variances color-coded with in a High to Low significance for the Supplier and Category combination nodes.

    > Hover over the **Documentation & Packing** rectangle to view supplier, category, item count, and average variance percentage.

5. Supply Variances are visible in a table summary of Items with their Supplier, Supplier Site details showing the delivery performance with statistics about the planned vs historical lead time, min and max range of variance, and variance percentage as well as Suggested Lead Time for review. 

    > Review the details and **note the item with highest variance percentage.** Select **all items checkbox** and click **View Order Details.**

    ![image006](images/image006.png)



6. Order Details screen provides historical information of purchase orders for the selected item(s) with Order, Shipping, and Receipt dates, etc.

    > Click on **View Chart**. 

    ![image007](images/image007.png)



7. The chart gives a graphical representation and more insights into the distribution of orders to understand the shipments that were on time or delayed.

    > Select the **Current Option** row under Availability Option, click on **Actions**, and then select **Availability Details**.

    ![image008](images/image008.png)

    > Examine the variance details of the shipments by **hovering over the plotted chart.**  
    
    When done click **X** to close the chart view.

8. The “Planning Advisor” in Supply Planning allows users to review Purchasing Lead Time Variances and gain Insights into supplier performance based on historical shipments. Suggested Lead Time changes can be added to simulation sets for further impact analysis before accepting and making changes accordingly.

## Summary

**Oracle Fusion Claud Supply Planning** combines planning supply, production, and inventory into a single application to:
-	**Make better decisions—faster**
Identify demand risk and evaluate the impact of demand changes on supply.
-	**Balance global demand and supply**
Proactively revise plans to address shortages and overloads based on the latest data from across the supply chain.
-	**Align enterprise business segments**
Reduce cost to serve, buffer variability, and stockouts by aligning business segment plans using a common supply network.
-	**Honor customer commitments**
Prioritize, simulate, and reschedule open orders based on the latest supply availability.
-	**Maximize shop floor throughput**
Develop high-quality, executable intraday factory schedules for your daily supply plans that maximize asset and component utilization.


In this example, we used Oracle Supply Planning’s “Planning Advisor” to review Purchasing Lead Time Variances and gain Insights into supplier performance based on historical shipments. The system makes recommendations for Lead Time updates, which can be added to simulation sets for a What-If scenario analysis before accepting the recommendations and making changes accordingly.  

**You have successfully completed the Activity!**

**For extra credit (and possibly some Oracle swag) please make sure you record the information regarding the Item with highest Lead Time Variance Percentage in the review Item Category Set.**
