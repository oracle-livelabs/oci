7. We can use the Mobile App to view item details such as part relationships, dimensions, and flags that drive decisions.

    > Select drop downs for **Dimensions** and **Flags.**

8. Dimensions help identify where an item can be put away.  Flags help to determine if items can be mixed with other items or if they can be packed with a wave.  Information that helps WMS drive directed movements. 

    > Once you have reviewed the Dimensions and Flags, click **X** to close the mobile app.

## Summary

Oracle Warehouse Management transforms warehouse and inventory management for the new and evolving fulfillment economy. The solution combines the speed and savings of the cloud with best-of-breed fulfillment functionality while giving companies a 360-degree view of their inventory without the high maintenance costs and upgrade trap of traditional solutions.

Today’s modern warehouse managers aren’t tied to a desk. They need access on the go to critical information to make smart decisions. With Oracle Warehouse Management, mobility is inherent, having been built-in from day one. Managers can view real-time analytics and reporting while users can perform all the essential activities (pick, pack, load, ship/manifest support, kitting, de-kitting, etc.)
to power best-in-class fulfillment operations.

In this example, we used Oracle Warehouse Management’s embedded Mobile App to look up item information.
