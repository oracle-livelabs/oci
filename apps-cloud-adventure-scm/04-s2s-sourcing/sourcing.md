## Task 1: Determine why the Automatic Award Recommendation has elected not to award EIP Inc. in this negotiation. 

1. You will need to go to the negotiations page.

    > Navigate to the **Procurement** tab and select **Negotiations**

2. The negotiations dashboard has Infolets with insights into sourcing programs and activity. This information is drillable to give the user an intuitive experience. You need to drill into Award Completed to analyze the recent sourcing negotiation.

    > In the **My Negotiations** Infolet select the **Award Completed** piece of the pie chart (Purple)

3. You could drill into the negotiation details by clicking the hyperlink on the negotiation number. However, you need to analyze the individual supplier responses, so you need to click the monitor icon.

    > Click the **Monitor** icon for Negotiation 31796

4. Here is the initial monitor page. There is some analytical information available at the top of the page. This includes the current value, potential savings, and supplier response amounts.  
    
    At the bottom of the page are the suppliers. Five were invited, and three responded. You can see the details to the right. You will notice EIP was ranked first but still wasn’t awarded so you must dive deeper.

    > Select **Actions** drop down in the top ribbon

5. In order to see more information about this negotiation you need to utilize the analytical tools available through Cloud Procurement. To do this, select analyze negotiation from the menu options.  

    > First, click **Analyze**. 

     Then, select **Analyze Negotiation** from the drop-down menu.

    ![Image007](images/image007.png)
    
    At the bottom of the page are the suppliers. Five were invited, and three responded. You can see the details to the right. Once again you will notice EIP was ranked first but still wasn’t awarded so you must dive deeper.

    > To highlight all the supplier responses, click the **white space** next to ‘Supplier’ as indicated.

    ![Image008](images/image008.png)

    > Once they are all highlighted in blue, click **Analyze**

    ![Image009](images/image009.png)



7. The table will populate with some of the supplier response data. To see the requirements sections, you will need to expose more fields.
    
    To expose more fields, simply use the tools to add some response elements to the table.

    > Click **Actions** drop-down, then select **Add or Remove Response Elements**

    ![Image0010](images/image010.png)

    > Click the **double right** icon to add all the requirement response elements to the table.

    ![Image0011](images/image011.png)

    > When all the desired response elements are in the right column click **OK** and the tool will update the table.

    ![Image0012](images/image012.png)



8. Once, the analysis has been run there will be more analytics provided at the top of the page. As you scroll down you will see comprehensive response details for each supplier including the requirement scoring. You will notice that EIP is missing a required certification and therefore they have not been awarded part of this negotiation. To ensure this doesn’t happen again or if you wish to let them re-bid this sourcing negotiation your team must communicate the need for this certification.
