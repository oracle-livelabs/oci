2. The negotiations dashboard has Infolets with insights into sourcing programs and activity. This information is drillable to give the user an intuitive experience. You need to drill into Award Completed to analyze the recent sourcing negotiation.

    > In the **My Negotiations** Infolet select the **Award Completed** piece of the pie chart (Purple)

3. You could drill into the negotiation details by clicking the hyperlink on the negotiation number. However, you need to analyze the individual supplier responses, so you need to click the monitor icon.

    > Click the **Monitor** icon for Negotiation 31796

4. Here is the initial monitor page with analytical information about responses. Notice EIP was ranked first, but wasn’t awarded. Let’s dive deeper to find why. We can use the analytical tools available through Cloud Procurement to analyze further.

    
    At the bottom of the page are the suppliers. Five were invited, and three responded. You can see the details to the right. You will notice EIP was ranked first but still wasn’t awarded so you must dive deeper.

    > Select **Actions** drop down in the top ribbon

    > First, click **Analyze**. 

     Then, select **Analyze Negotiation** from the drop-down menu.

6. Here are more analytics built into the sourcing process. The analysis breaks down the awards by supplier, total savings, and savings by line item.

    ![Image007](images/image007.png)
    
    At the bottom of the page are the suppliers. Five were invited, and three responded. You can see the details to the right. Once again you will notice EIP was ranked first but still wasn’t awarded so you must dive deeper.

7. Notice EIP is ranked first but has lowest score.

> Click the **score ‘50’** to access EIP’s response details.

8. Now we see how the Procurement system AI scored a zero and automatically disqualified EIP because they are missing a required certification which was set as pre-built knockout criteria.

    If this were manually scored we could add notes to the requirement scoring for review.
