## Summary

Oracle Warehouse Management transforms warehouse and inventory management for the new and evolving fulfillment economy. The solution combines the speed and savings of the cloud with best-of-breed fulfillment functionality while giving companies a 360-degree view of their inventory without the high maintenance costs and upgrade trap of traditional solutions.

Today’s modern warehouse managers aren’t tied to a desk. They need access on the go to critical information to make smart decisions. With Oracle Warehouse Management, mobility is inherent, having been built-in from day one. Managers can view real-time analytics and reporting while users can perform all the essential activities (pick, pack, load, ship/manifest support, kitting, de-kitting, etc.) to power best-in-class fulfillment operations.

In this example, we used Oracle Warehouse Management’s embedded Mobile App to modify the quantity on a License Plate
