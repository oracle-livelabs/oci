## Task 1: Use Oracle Global Order Promising to determine most profitable to promise and on-time delivery options to satisfy customers' needs.

5. The Fulfillment View provides all the relevant details for each line such as inventory details, promising dates, scheduling details, and shipping parameters. Real-time availability checking and order scheduling allows users to quickly investigate delivery exceptions.  

    > Click on **Check Availability**.

6. The Availability Status indicates the sales order will be delivered on-time!  Oracle Cloud Global Order Promising has found sufficient supply to fulfill the order.

    > Review the details and other available options by clicking on **View Availability Options**.

7. The Availability Options shows multiple options based on different shipping methods. However, Oracle Cloud Global Order Promising using Profitable to Promise considered the default option with lowest fulfillment cost. 

    > **Review the options, and record the cost, shipping date, and shipping method for the most profitable selection.**

8. If you want to see more options, you can run a “What If” scenario to determine what would happen if you make a change to the currently selected option.  

    > Select the **Blank Box** next to the line highlighted.

9. Availability Details will give you a full view into the specifics of the fulfillment process, including all purchases, manufacturing, and transfers that are required.

    > GOP can be configured to consider several variables when considering profitability.

10. The “What If” scenario allows you to include substitute products, split the line into multiple shipments, and even ignore reservations for other customers.  

    > Answer Yes to return to the first three questions. <br>

    > (1) Allow Substitutions <br>
    > (2) Allow Splits <br>
    > (3) Ignore Reservations <br>

## Summary

Order Promising is a critical supply chain process that drives major costs and customer service levels. Every company’s reputation rests on their ability to provide the highest levels of customer service, while their financial viability depends on their ability to determine both reliable and profitable order fulfillment. 

In this example, we used Oracle Global Order Promising’s robust profitable to promise capabilities to commit to Steel Fitness’ request with confidence and successfully fulfill our customer’s needs with the lowest cost available.
