Utilizing the OTM Workbench, users have access to all pertinent data necessary to review dashboards and perform relevant logistics activities.  By leveraging OTM, businesses can achieve improved visibility, increased efficiency, and reduced costs in their logistics operations.

    - to understand why this symbol was populated.
    
    Utilizing the Workbench functionality, Casey can easily get to all the information she needs to do her job.
   
    Casey reviews the notes and now understands what the customer has requested.


    
## Task 2: Planners plan 3 orders into a shipment

1. Casey is ready to run a plan that will determine the best mode, carrier, and route for each of these new orders using Oracle’s industry leading Optimization technology to determine the best way to guarantee the customer meets their on-time requirements.

    Select **Actions – Bulk Plan**

    A New Box will pop open labeled Shipment Planning

    **Select** the **OK** bottom at the bottom left.

    A new window will open showing the details of Shipment Planning/Bulk Plan.  
    
    The plan will start with the **Status of Running**.

## Task 3: View Shipment with Load Configuration



1. Back on the workbench, Casey can view the assigned carrier is **SCNN**.  She can also view the planned route on the map.

    > **Select** the **Map tab** on the top right panel.

    **Select** any order by clicking anywhere in the row to highlight it (the row will turn light blue). 
    
    The **Related Shipment** will automatically populate in the **Related Shipments** panel below.

    **Select the check box** in the mapping column to add the shipment to the map.

2. Casey also knows that based on their configuration in OTM, the application will automatically ensure that high priority orders will be positioned based on their importance.  The optimization creates a 3D visual representation of the load that allows the warehouse to efficiently load the truck based on the order priority.   Casey reviews the visualization and is happy to see that OTM recognized that the high priority order is placed closest to the door – ready for the customer to easily unload the critical item that confirms Casey’s customer can continue production without interruption.

    > **Select** the **Load Config** tab on **the top right panel**.
        
    **Highlight** the shipment by clicking anywhere in the row.

    > **Change** the **Color Scheme** to **Priority**.
    
    Users have the ability edit the configuration by clicking on the pencil.

## Summary

In the old days, Casey would have had to review each of the outbound shipments, find the deliveries on the floor, ask the warehouse loader to find the box and see if it will fit at the end of the truck.  Casey is happy that OTM did all the heavy lifting for her allowing Casey to spend time on more strategic tasks like how the company is performing toward the company’s ESG goals.  Casey can easily view this information by selecting one of the Data Visualization tabs in the Control Tower Workbench.
