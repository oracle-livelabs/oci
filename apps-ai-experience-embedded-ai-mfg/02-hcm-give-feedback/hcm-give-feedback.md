## Introduction

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

### Objectives

Now that we’ve updated the sales opportunity, we need to provide feedback for the sales reps that had an impact with the customer. Use generative AI to draft feedback comments to help improve employee performance and engagement.

## Task 1: Search and open the Feedback Center

1. If not already logged in, follow the steps shown below.

    Login to the lab environment using the credentials provided. Make sure to use your assigned user.

2. Open and Explore Feedback Center

   You are easily able to find areas you’re looking for within the system utilizing the navigation tools built into the UI. </br>
   
      >  Using the Global Search bar at the top, enter *Feedback Center - Me* and click to navigate to the **Feedback Center**

      ![Use Global Search for Feedback Center](images/image018.png " ")
   
    Once in the feedback center, you’ll be able to see the history of feedback given to you, or feedback that you’ve given to others. This allows for a one stop shop for users to view all their related feedback.  
   

## Task 2: Select the Sales Rep and Give Feedback

1. Navigate to **Give Feedback** and select a Sales Rep.

      > Click on the **Feedback About Others** tab

2. Search for the Sales Rep 

   There are different options when it comes to who gets feedback, and how it’s viewed by the business. Since this is part of the unified suite, it’s easy to find your team. 
   
      > -	Search & select employee: *Natalie SalesRep*
      > -   Define visibility: *Managers and Natalie SalesRep*

      ![Select Employee to give Feedback for](images/image021.png " ")  

3. Enter your feedback details for the Sales Rep

   Utilizing the built in AI, it makes it much easier to issue feedback. Instead of having to type an entire paragraph, you can provide a couple of key words or phrases and the built in AI tool will generate the rest.

      > -   Click into the feedback text box 
      > -	Enter the text below
   
      ```

      Great job with Antero. You showed ability to understand their needs and know our products well.
      </copy>
      ```

      > -   Click on the **AI Assist** button

   The AI tool will wait for final approval from the user before posting the feedback. This is important because it ensures that the user has final say over what the AI generates. 

      **Optional:**  

      The sales VP values positive feedback but also likes to give his team constructive feedback so they are always learning and growing. He notices the generated feedback does not include anything constructive, so he needs to add more

      > Add in additional context
      > -   Add a space beneath the initial paragraph
      > -   Enter text similar to the line below
   
      ```
      <copy>
      improving ability to always set next steps to drive towards progression
      </copy>
      ```

      > -   Click on the **AI Assist** button
