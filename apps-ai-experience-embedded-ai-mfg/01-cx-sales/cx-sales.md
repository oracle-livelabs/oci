      As a sales representative, when I log into CRM to get my day started, I’m quickly brough to my list of opportunities. I see a new opportunity in my list for Enterprise generator package and want to do my due diligence.

## Task 2: Assess the Opportunity

1. Initiate the **Deal Advisor**.

      Let’s see how AI assesses opportunities in real-time using Deal Advisor AI agent to get insights based on current and historical sales data, customer insights, engagements, deal progress and all the opportunity-related data

      The agent helps sellers and their managers identify upsell potential, mitigate risks, develop strategies based on similar won opportunities, suggest next best actions and more.

     > 1.	In the search, type *Deal Advisor*
     > 2.   Select *Deal Advisor* option from the drop down

      ![Initiate Deal Advisor](images/image004.png " ")

      The **Deal Advisor** AI Agent chat window opens

2. Let's get an overview of the opportunity. 

      When the agent opens, you are presented with suggestions. These guide you to areas of value within the opportunity. 

      > Select the first suggestion - *Give me a brief overview of this opportunity*.

      ![Request Opportunity Overview](images/image005.png " ")  

3. Ask the AI Agent a follow up question

    The deal advisor delivers actionable insights to sales teams, accelerates deal cycles, and improves win rates by helping sellers focus on the right actions at the right time. Managers can use the agent to get brief but comprehensive insights into the deal, customer engagements, and proactively identify risks. It will also generate follow-up questions based on the information generated. 
     
     >   Select the last option

   ![Ask Follow up Question](images/image006.png " ")

    Using historical references, data within the opportunity, and data from ongoing deals, the agent is able to prioritize next steps in order to close this deal. You notice one of these steps is to secure a firm commitment 

    > Close the agent by clicking the **X** in the top right of the agent

      ![Exit Agent](images/image007.png " ")

## Task 3: Using Generative AI create and send the customer an email

1. Create and send email

      Finally, the AI agent can even help you draft an email to the customer to secure their commitment.

    >  In the search bar type in **send email** and select the *Send Email* option

    We will utilize the built in AI to generate an email and automatically send it to our customer. 

    > -   Add a **Subject** like *Manufacturing Commitment*
    > -   In the AI bar at the bottom of the email editor type in the text below
   
      ```txt
