## About this AI Experience

A Sales Director led his team of three experienced account managers on a trip to meet with a major national gym chain headquartered in Houston. Their goal: to convince the chain to select their company as its primary equipment manufacturer for all new and renovated locations. Following extensive preparation, the team arrived at the client's corporate office, ready to present how their innovative smart fitness machines, flexible supply chain, and reliable manufacturing processes could support the gym chain’s rapid growth and evolving member needs. The meeting concluded on a strong note, with enthusiastic interest from the client’s leadership team. Now, the Operations Director leverages Oracle’s embedded AI tools to efficiently manage post-meeting action items—tracking follow-ups, customizing product proposals, and streamlining approvals—to ensure the deal advances smoothly and all commitments are met without delays.
