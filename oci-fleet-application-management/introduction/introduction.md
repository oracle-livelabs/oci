# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Get hands-on with OCI Fleet Application Management and learn how to streamline the lifecycle of complex enterprise applications. In this workshop, you’ll provision infrastructure resources, then dive into real-world patching of Oracle Fusion Middleware across web and application tiers—all in one unified, automated experience. Whether you're modernizing operations or enhancing software compliance, this workshop equips you with practical skills to manage application fleets at scale.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

**OCI Fleet Application Management (FAM)** simplifies and automates the management of application resources on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It streamlines key operations like provisioning, patching, and software compliance, helping teams manage large-scale environments with reduced manual effort and lower operational risk.

In this workshop, you'll use core FAM components to define infrastructure and maintain middleware deployments efficiently:

* **Catalog Items**: Reusable templates that define the configuration of OCI resources like compute instances, storage, and networking. These serve as blueprints for provisioning.
* **Runbooks**: Workflows that automate lifecycle operations such as provisioning infrastructure or applying patches, using defined sequences of tasks and parameters.
* **Fleets**: Logical groupings of similar resources (e.g., by environment or application type) that allow bulk operations, such as provisioning or patching, to be applied consistently.
* **Products & Product Stacks**: Representations of software components (e.g., WebLogic, Java, OHS) and their combinations, used to organize and manage middleware environments.
* **Jobs**: Executions of Runbooks tied to specific operations, such as provisioning or patching, across selected targets in a Fleet.
* **Schedules & Maintenance Windows**: Define when lifecycle operations, like patching, should run on a one-time or recurring basis within designated timeframes that align with operational needs and minimize business impact.

With these components, FAM enables scalable, repeatable management of your application infrastructure, ensuring consistency and control across your OCI environment.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Define and provision infrastructure resources (e.g, Compute, Networking, Storage) using Fleet Application Management Catalog Item, Runbook and resource grouping strategies.
* Patch a real-world Oracle Fusion Middleware deployment spanning web and application tiers using Fleet Application Management.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
