# Getting Started with OCI Email Delivery with Postfix

## About this Workshop

This workshop will walk through the setup of OCI Email Delivery. Postfix and Mailx will be used in the last lab to test the setup. Email Delivery can be used throughout OCI so you may choose to test it elsewhere and use the last lab as optional. 

This workshop is a good starting point to get a basic configuration of OCI Email Delivery that you can later customize for your specific needs. The lab will utilize OCI Email Delivery, OCI DNS Management and OCI Compute for the Postfix components.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 Hour
