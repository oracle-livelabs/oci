## Introduction

This lab will show the setup of your domain in the Oracle Email Delivery Service. In order to complete this lab, you will need a domain that you mange and control. You will need to make DNS changes so it's important that you own and control this domain.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

5. After a brief time, your domain will become *active* and you may move onto the next task.


## Task 2: Create DKIM for your Email Domain
