# Setup OCI Email Delivery Service

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the steps of setting up OCI Email Services. This will help us email Doctors, Patients or any Health official with the required data. For example, we can email transcribed text to Doctor after the patient uploads an audio file or mail once the medical expenses have been approved or rejected. 
 
### About OCI Email Delivery

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [**(OCI) Email Delivery**](https://www.oracle.com/in/cloud/networking/email-delivery/) helps organizations reach their intended audiences by enabling them to send bulk email with high rates of successful inbox placement. With email message volume rising every year, reaching intended recipients continues to be a significant challenge, even for reputable senders. Email Delivery, built on Oracle Dyn's proven technology, makes that challenge exponentially easier.

Now fully integrated as part of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Email Delivery has been helping organizations with large sending needs overcome the challenges of inbox placement for more than a decade. With proven reliability, scale, and ease of use, Email Delivery ensures organizations can have high confidence that messages will reach their target audiences as intended.
  
Estimated Time: 20 minutes.

## Task 3: Create Approved Sender    

1. An approved sender is associated with a compartment and only exists in the region where it was configured. If you create an approved sender in the US West (Phoenix) region, you canâ€™t send email through the US East (Ashburn) region with that sender. 

    Approved Senders email id that will be representing From email address.
