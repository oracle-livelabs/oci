# Understanding Mammography and Breast Cancer (Optional)

## AI Vision

OCI Vision is an AI service for performing deep-learningâ€“based image analysis at scale. With prebuilt models available out of the box, developers can easily build image recognition and text recognition into their applications without machine learning (ML) expertise. For industry-specific use cases, developers can automatically train custom vision models with their own data. These models can be used to detect visual anomalies in manufacturing, organize digital media assets, and tag items in images to count products or shipments.  

### **Computer vision**

**Gain insights from visual data**

Automatically extract textual or visual information from images and use that to power analytic applications. Combine visual information from images with additional inputs, such as product sales history and customer reviews to gain a holistic sense of trends, such as product availability and popularity.

**Digital asset management**

Enrich image-based files with metadata, including objects and colors for better indexing and retrieval in a digital asset management system or larger data warehouse. Easily retrieve images for uses ranging from intelligent search to retail management.

**Important**

This workshop provides a basic example of using OCI Vision and other AI services. This example is for illustration and demonstration purposes only and isn't intended to replace any medical imagery analysis tool or official diagnosis recommendation made by a professional. Users need to receive the proper regulated compliance and approvals before using for medical and diagnostic use.
 
Estimated Workshop Time: 20 mins

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* What is a Mammogram?
* How does Breast Cancer look like on a Mammogram?
* Other Breast abnormalities
* Normal Breast Mammogram 
* Breast Cancer Mammogram  

### Prerequisites (Optional)
 
This lab assumes you have:

* No Prerequisites for this Lab 

## Task 1: What is a Mammogram?

 A mammogram is an X-ray picture of the breast. Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer. Regular mammograms are the best tests doctors have to find breast cancer early, sometimes up to three years before it can be felt. Patients should continue to get mammograms according to recommended time intervals. Mammograms work best when they can be compared with previous ones. This allows the radiologist to compare them to look for changes in your breasts.

## Task 2: How does Breast Cancer look like on a Mammogram?

Any area that does not look like normal tissue is a possible cause for concern. The radiologist will look for areas of white, high-density tissue and note its size, shape, and edges. A lump or tumour is a focused white area on a mammogram. Tumours can be cancerous or benign.

If a tumour is benign, it is not a health risk and is unlikely to grow or change shape. Most tumours found in the breasts are non-cancerous.

Small white specks are usually harmless. The radiologist will check their shape and pattern, as they can sometimes be a sign of cancer.

## Task 3: Other Breast abnormalities

As well as dense breast tissue and possible tumours, a radiologist will look for anything unusual on a mammogram.

Other abnormalities include:

* Cysts, which are small fluid-filled sacs. Most are simple cysts, which have a thin wall and are not cancerous. If a doctor cannot classify a cyst as a simple cyst, they may do further tests to ensure that it is not cancerous.
* Calcifications, which are deposits of calcium. Larger deposits of calcium are called macrocalcifications, and they usually occur as a result of ageing. Smaller deposits are called microcalcifications. Depending on the appearance of the microcalcifications, a doctor may test them for possible signs of cancer.
* Fibroadenomas are benign tumours in the breast. They are round and may feel like marble. People in their 20s and 30s are more likelyTrusted Source to have a fibroadenoma, but they can occur at any age.
* Scar tissue, which often appears white on a mammogram. It is best to inform a doctor of any scarring on the breasts beforehand.
 
## Task 4: Normal Breast Mammogram

1. Sample image of Normal Breast.

## Task 5: Breast Cancer Mammogram  

1. Sample images of most likely Breast Cancer.
