# Introduction to OCI Speech

## About this workshop

In this workshop, we will go through the steps of converting an audio file into text. This text content becomes input for OpenAI, and it responds with an AI message. 

In the Healthcare world, this finds two use cases: one in Medical Transcription, where hospitals typically receive voice files dictating medical documents from healthcare providers or audio messages from patients. The voice files are converted into text files, which can be further processed by emailing concerned doctors or patients.
The other use case is when patients can ask virtual doctors about their health symptoms and receive medical suggestions from a virtual AI doctor. 

**AI Speech to Text or OCI Speech**.  

OCI Speech is an AI service that applies automatic speech recognition technology to transform audio-based content into text. Developers can easily make API calls to integrate OCI Speech’s pretrained models into their applications. OCI Speech can be used for accurate, text-normalized, time-stamped transcription via the console and REST APIs as well as command-line interfaces or SDKs. You can also use OCI Speech in an OCI Data Science notebook session. With OCI Speech, you can filter profanities, get confidence scores for both single words and complete transcriptions, and more.

**Prebuilt acoustic and language models**
OCI Speech uses automatic speech recognition, a deep learning process, to derive accurate transcription from natural conversations. Get started easily by using prebuilt acoustic and language models that don’t require users to have data science experience.

**Analyze data from audio and video files**
Search, index, and decipher data buried in your audio files. Convert recorded audio conversations to textual data to analyze with AI services. For example, you can use OCI Language to retrieve the sentiment and OCI Speech’s anomaly detection capabilities to identify chances of customer churn.

**Native multilingual support**
OCI Speech ASR models support English, Spanish, and Portuguese, so you can transcribe your audio files in your preferred languages.

**Easy to integrate**
OCI Speech is a versatile service that can be called via REST APIs, different SDKs, and Oracle CLI. Developers can easily deploy a scalable speech service without having data science or ML expertise.
 
Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Provision Oracle Autonomous Database
* Upload the Audio file to OCI Object storage and Convert it into Text through Speech AI.
* Integrate with OpenAI, where the AI engine responds back to the audio inputs. 
* Mail Audio clip and convert speech text to Doctor, Healthcare Administrator, or Patient.
   
### Prerequisites (Optional)
 
This lab assumes you have:
