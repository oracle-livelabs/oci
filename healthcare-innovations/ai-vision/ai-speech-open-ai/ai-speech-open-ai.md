# Oracle Speech and OpenAI Chat GPTs Integration

## Introduction

The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that requires understanding or generating natural language and code. The OpenAI API can also be used to generate and edit images or convert speech into text. OpenAI offer a range of models with different capabilities and price points, as well as the ability to fine-tune custom models.

If you are planning to use [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) AI instead of OpenAI please refer [this LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7082361643715747840/)

**GPTs**

OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a GPT model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. GPTs can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more. Read more in OpenAI's introductory [GPT guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) 

You can ask Questions like 

**First Example**

*please help me with common cold curing*

and OpenAI GPT engine would repond back as 

*1. Get plenty of rest. 2. Drink lots of fluids, such as water, juice, and clear broth. 3. Use saline nose drops to relieve congestion. 4. Sip warm liquids such as broth, tea, or apple cider. 5. Take over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce fever and aches. 6. Use a humidifier or take a warm, steamy shower to help ease congestion. 7. Gargle with warm salt water to soothe a sore throat. 8. Avoid contact with people who have colds. 9. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. 10. Increase your vitamin C intake.*

**Another Example**

*help me detect breast cancer please*

OpenAI would respond back as 

*1. Make an appointment with your doctor for a physical exam. 2. Ask your doctor to perform a breast exam to check for lumps. 3. Get regular mammograms as recommended for your age. 4. Talk to your doctor about other possible tests, such as a breast MRI or ultrasound. 5. Pay attention to any changes in your breasts, such as a lump or thickening, discharge, or nipple inversion. 6. Consider genetic testing if you have a family history of breast cancer.*

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create OpenAI Key
* Understand OpenAI Authentication  
* Integrating Oracle Speech AI Output with OpenAI
* OpenAI Integration with Oracle APEX without using OCI Speech AI


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Completed previous labs under Speech AI series. (Lab 11 to Lab 13)

## Task 1: Create OpenAI Key

1. Create an Account at OpenAI and Create a Key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
  
    ![OpenAI Key](images/open-ai-key.png " ")
  
## Task 2: Understand OpenAI Authentication 

1. If you want to specifically enable OpenAI plugins to work with your API, you can provide a client secret during the plugin installation flow. This means that all traffic from OpenAI plugins will be authenticated but not on a user level. This flow benefits from a simple end user experience but less control from an API perspective.

    * To start, select "Develop your own plugin" in the ChatGPT plugin store, and enter the domain where your plugin is hosted.
    * In ai-plugin.json, set auth.type to "service_http" as is shown in our service level auth example.
    * You will be prompted for your service access token, which is a string specified in your code.
        * We securely store an encrypted copy of your service access token to enable plugin installation without additional authentication.
        * The service access token is sent in the Authorization header for plugin requests.
    * Once you add your service access token into the ChatGPT UI, you will be presented with a verification token.
    * Add the verification token to your ai-plugin.json file under the auth section as shown Python code below.

    ```python
        <copy>
            "auth": 
            {
            "type": "service_http",
            "authorization_type": "bearer",
                "verification_tokens": {
                    "openai": "OpenAI's Key"
                }
            } 
        </copy>
        ```

2. OAuth Code Snippet. In the below example of what the OAuth configuration inside of the ai-plugin.json file might look like:
 
    ```json
    <copy>
    "auth": {
            "type": "oauth",
            "client_url": "https://example.com/authorize",
            "scope": "",
            "authorization_url": "https://example.com/auth/",
            "authorization_content_type": "application/json",
            "verification_tokens": {
                "openai": "OpenAI's Key"
            }
        }
    </copy>
    ```
 
## Task 3: Integrating Oracle Speech AI Output with OpenAI
