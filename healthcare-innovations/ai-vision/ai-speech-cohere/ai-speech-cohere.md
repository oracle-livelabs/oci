# Oracle Speech AI and Generative AI Integration

## Introduction

In this Lab, we will see how to integrate [OCI AI Speech](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/speech/) Input as prompts to [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) AI Service and [Oracle Generative AI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/concepts.htm).
   
You can ask Questions like 

Example 1
  
*please help me with common cold curing*

Cohere would respond back as

*1. Get plenty of rest. 2. Drink lots of fluids, such as water, juice, and clear broth. 3. Use saline nose drops to relieve congestion. 4. Sip warm liquids such as broth, tea, or apple cider. 5. Take over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce fever and aches. 6. Use a humidifier or take a warm, steamy shower to help ease congestion. 7. Gargle with warm salt water to soothe a sore throat. 8. Avoid contact with people who have colds. 9. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. 10. Increase your vitamin C intake.*

Example 2

*Hello doctor, I have pain in my neck, please help me thank you*

Cohere would respond back as

*There are a few things you can do to help reduce the pain in your neck. First, try to identify the cause of the pain. If it is due to a specific activity, such as typing or writing, try to take a break from that activity. Second, try to relax your neck muscles. You can do this by gently massaging them or by taking a warm bath. Third, try to ensure that your neck is properly supported when you are sitting or lying down. You can do this by using a pillow or by placing your head on a soft surface. Finally, if the pain is severe or persists for more than a few days, you should seek medical attention.*
 
Estimated Time: 30 minutes.

### About Oracle Generative AI

Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) [Generative AI](https://www.oracle.com/in/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/large-language-models/) is a fully managed service available via API to seamlessly integrate these versatile language models into a wide range of use cases, including writing assistance, summarization, and chat.

This lab will show a hands-on approach to building AI-driven innovative applications using Oracle Generative AI services and low code Oracle APEX Applications. We will test our AI model with questions related to Neurology, Weather conditions, Writing emails, Generating Java code, Generating SQL, or even how to make mixed fruit jam. The Oracle AI Language Translation Service can easily translate these AI response texts into various languages.

Oracle Beta Programs Preview the future of OCI today: You can request access from [here](https://apexadb.oracle.com/ords/f?p=102:100) and follow that link for more details.

Assumption/Requirements: You have already installed Oracle APEX workspace and have access to OCI Generative AI service. Your Administrator has set up OCI Policies for Generative AI access, or you have Administrator privileges in your tenancy.

We will look at two options to run Generative AI.

  * Cloud console - playground
  * Oracle APEX Application

2. Generate Cohere API Key and read API key [limitations](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/going-live)

    ![Generative AI](images/cohere-key.png) 

## Task 2: Getting AI Response from Cohere 

1. Review the request JSON, Call API end point at https://api.cohere.ai/v1/generate

    ```json
    <copy> 
        {  
            "model": "command",
            "prompt": "Your input text here",
            "max_tokens": 300,
            "temperature": 0.9,
            "k": 0,
            "stop_sequences": [],
            "return_likelihoods": "NONE"
    }   
    </copy>
    ```

2. Review the response JSON

    ```json
    <copy> 
        {
            "id": "2c5fd5d6-743c-4a52-****-*****",
            "generations": [
                {
                    "id": "46907fbb-1d86-40fc-ba70-806d658ee901",
                    "text": "\n your answer goes here  "
                }
            ],
            "prompt": "your question goes here",
            "meta": { "api_version": 
                        { 
                            "version": "1" 
                        } 
                    }
    }
    </copy>
    ```

3. PL/SQL Code to send request and get response back from Cohere, you can create an Oracle APEX Dynamic Region to display the results taking input from a page item after submitting the page. Construct PL/SQL Code block, Replace this code in the PL/SQL Dynamic content window, use [JSON_TABLE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/JSON_TABLE.html) to create a PL/SQL cursor

    ```

    At this stage you can view Java or Python code in the console.

## Task 5: Oracle Generative AI with Oracle APEX

Running Generative AI Application inside Oracle APEX is a three step process.

* Create Web Credentials.
* Create Oracle APEX page 
* Create Process with PL/SQL code block.

We will see these steps in next few tasks.

## Task 6: Create Web Credentials

If you have already created web credentials then you can ignore this step, Oracle APEX Web Credentials provides a convenient and secure mechanism for storing the following types of credentials:

* Basic Authentication (Username & password)
* OAuth2 Client Credentials (Client ID & Client Secret)
* OCI Native Authentication (Access Oracle Cloud Resources, e.g., Object Storage)
* HTTP Header (The credential is added to the REST request as an HTTP Header)
* URL Query String (The credential is added to the URL of the REST request as a Query String Parameter).
  
1. In the APEX top navigation, Select App Builder, Click on Workspace Utilities

    ![Generative AI Accommodation](images/web-credentials-1.png)

2. Select Web Credentials

4. Few important request parameters
   
   * Tokens: A token is a word, part of a word, or a punctuation. For example, apple is a token and friendship is made up of two tokens, friend and ship.  
   * Temperature:How random to generate the output text. To generate the same output for a prompt every time you run that prompt, use 0. To generate a random new text for that prompt, increase the temperature. Default temperature is 1
   * Likelihood: In a large language model's output, how likely it would be for a token to follow the current generated token. When a large language model generates a new token for the output text, a likelihood is assigned to all tokens, where tokens with higher likelihoods are more likely to follow the current token.
