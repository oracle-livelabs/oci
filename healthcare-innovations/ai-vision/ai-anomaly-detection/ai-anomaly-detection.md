# Diagnose Cardiovascular disease with ECG and OCI Anomaly Detection

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps of detecting Cardiovascular disease with Electrocardiogram (ECG) Reports and [**OCI Anomaly Detection**](https://www.oracle.com/in/artificial-intelligence/anomaly-detection/).

Estimated Time: 30 minutes.  
 
### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
 
* Approach to ECG Interpretation - ECG Data Preparation
* Upload the ECG Training data to OCI Object storage
* Create and Train the ECG Model
* Review Model and Data settings
* Detect ECG Anomalies

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* You have Completed **Get Started**, **Setup Policies** lab and have required access to Create OCI Anomaly Detection Models and OCI Object storage
 
An **ECG** is a simple, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart. An ECG can help diagnose certain heart conditions, including **abnormal heart rhythms and coronary heart disease** (heart attack and angina).

Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG ), a recording of the heart's electrical activity through repeated cardiac cycles. It is an electrogram of the heart, which is a graph of voltage versus time of the heart's electrical activity using electrodes placed on the skin.  

Identify normal v/s fast v/s slow v/s irregular heartbeats with ECG reports.

### About OCI Anomaly Detection

[**OCI Anomaly Detection**](https://www.oracle.com/in/artificial-intelligence/anomaly-detection/) is an AI service that provides real-time and batch anomaly detection for univariate and multivariate time series data. Through a simple user interface, organizations can create and train models to detect anomalies and identify unusual behavior, changes in trends, outliers, and more.

**Proprietary anomaly detection algorithms**

OCI Anomaly Detection algorithms, backed by more than 150 patents, detect anomalies earlier with fewer false alarms. These algorithms work together to ensure higher sensitivity and better false alarm avoidance than other machine learning (ML) approaches, such as neural nets and support vector machines.

**Intelligent data preprocessing**

OCI Anomaly Detection provides multiple data processing techniques that account for errors and imperfections in real-world input data, such as from low-resolution sensors. It automatically identifies and fixes data quality issuesâ€”resulting in fewer false alarms, better operations, and more accurate results.
  
## Task 1: Approach to ECG Interpretation - ECG Data Preparation
 
1. ECG Data Preparation in CSV format that contains timestamp and corresponding ECG reading, for the sake of simplicity we are calling this as **beat_measure**, save this file as *normal-ecg-training-data.csv*

    > **Note:** From Google search, and look for *download normal ecg report in CSV format* and download from any of your favourite data sources or bring your own data.

    ![Beat Measurements](images/beat-measure.png " ")

    > **Note 1:**  In general, when measuring amplitudes of waves or complexes, the units are expressed in mm, and when measuring lengths for intervals, the units are expressed in seconds or milliseconds (ms). If each small box is equal to 0.04 seconds or 1 mm, then the standard ECG speed is 1 mm per 0.04 seconds, or 25 mm per second.

## Task 2: Upload the ECG Training data to OCI Object storage

It is assumed that you have access to create OCI Bucket and Upload Objects to OCI Bucket, if not please verify previous labs in this workshop. From the top left navigation of cloud.oracle.com under **Storage** services select **Buckets**

1. Access OCI Object storage Bucket and Upload CSV file. 

    ![Beat Measurements](images/ecg-upload-1.png " ") 

2. Create seperate folder ECG Training data upload in OCI Bucket.

## Task 3: Create and Train the ECG Model

**Univariate anomaly detection**: Univariate anomaly detection (UAD) refers to the problem of identifying anomalies in a single time series data. A single time series data contains timestamped values for one signal, such as metric or measure.

1. From the top left navigation of cloud.oracle.com under **Analytics & AI** services select **Anomaly Detection**

    ![Create ECG Model](images/ecg-model-1.png " ")

2. Upload Sample ECG CSV Data file, Sensitivity can be left to default or select 0.5 and click **Detect**

    ![ECG Reading](images/ecg-reading-5.png " ") 

    * <span style="color: #E29E1D;">**Orange lines**</span> indicates the actual input value of a signal, purple line indicates the predicted value by the machine learning model, and <span style="color: red;">**Red lines**</span> indicates anomaly being detected at that timestamp.
    * The anomaly score per signal shows the significance of anomaly at individual signal level for a given timestamp. *Not all the signals flag anomalies at the same time*.
    * The aggregated anomaly score indicates the significance of anomaly for a given timestamp by considering the anomaly from all signals together.
