# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Proactively de-risking operational resources and detecting issues across the areas of vegetation overgrowth, utility assets, and factory machinery can be a time-consuming and labor intensive process, but it can be automated with AI. In this hands-on lab, you'll build a custom machine learning model to detect rust on utility poles. No data science experience required! This solution can be applied across a number of different related use cases and sectors. Bring your questions and ask our AI experts for their advice on how to apply this technology to your scenario.

Estimated Time: 90 minutes
