# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Detecting issues across the areas of vegetation overgrowth, utility assets, and factory machinery can be time consuming and labor intensive, but it can be automated with AI. In this lab, you will build a custom machine learning model to detect rust on utility poles using images collected by drones. This type of solution can be applied across several different verticals and requires no machine learning experience!

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

- Learn how to use the OCI Vision service
- Label images with OCI Data Labeling
- Build a custom OCI Vision model
