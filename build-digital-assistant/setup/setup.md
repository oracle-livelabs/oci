# Set Up the Shopping Centre Digital Assistant

## Introduction

Digital assistants are virtual personal assistants that users can interact with using natural language. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to the appropriate skill.

Among other things, the digital assistant:

- Greets the user upon access.
- Upon user request, lists what it can do and provides entry points into the given skills.
- Routes explicit user requests to the appropriate skill.
- Handles interruptions to flows.
- Handles disambiguation.
- Handles requests to exit the bot.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Explore the Digital Assistant
* Add PizzaSkill to the DA

## Task 1: Explore the Digital Assistant

The starter digital assistant (or, DA for short) that you just cloned consists of two skills – FinancialBot and RetailBot. Later, we'll add PizzaSkill to the DA.

To familiarize yourself with the DA, try it out by following these steps:
1. Click the main menu icon to open the side menu.
2. Click **Development** and select **Digital Assistants**.
3. Click the main menu icon again to collapse the side menu.
4. On the Digital Assistants dashboard, find the tile for your copy of **ODA\_HOL2019** and select it to open it up in the designer.
5. Ensure the Skills icon is selected. ![](./images/skills-icon.png " ")
  Notice that FinancialBot and RetailBot are listed there.
6. Select the RetailBot skill and browse the attributes of its description and interaction model.
7. Select the FinancialBot skill and browse the attributes of its description and interaction model.
8. Select the Intents icon. ![](./images/left_nav_intents.png " ")
9. Note the three intents.
  These are built in to all digital assistants. Here's what they are for:
    - **exit**: applies when the user signals the desire to exit the current conversation or context in the digital assistant.
    - **help**: applies when the user asks for help or orientation.
    - **unresolvedIntent**: applies to user input that doesn't match well with the exit and help intents.
10. Click the Settings icon and select the **Configurations** tab.
  Notice the **Routing Parameters, Conversation Parameters** and **Other Parameters** sections.
11. Click the Train icon, click **Submit**, and then wait a few seconds for the training to complete.
12. Find the tester icon on the top of the page and click it. ![](./images/test_button.png " ")
13. In the tester's **Message** field, type *help me*, press Enter, and note the DA's greeting and initial menu.
14. Click the **Reset** button.
15. Now try entering *Do I have enough money in my savings account*, pressing Enter, and observing the response.
16. Close the tester.

## Task 2: Add PizzaSkill to the DA

With a new pizzeria opening in the shopping centre, we want the digital assistant to support this merchant as well. So let's add the PizzaSkill to our digital assistant and then train the digital assistant so that it can work with the new skill:

1. In your DA, select the Skills icon. ![](./images/skills-icon.png " ")
2. Click **Add Skill** button.
3. Find the tile for your copy of PizzaSkill.
  > **Note**: The skill won't appear there if you haven't completed the Publish the Skill part of the workshop (Lab 1).
4. In the tile for your skill, click the Add Skill icon. ![](./images/add-skill-icon.png " ")
5. Click **Close** to close the Skill Catalog.
6. Click the Train icon, click **Submit**, and then wait a few seconds for the training to complete.
