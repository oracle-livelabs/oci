# Prepare the Skill to send an SMS

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the custom component to send text messages from the Skill. In the previous lab, we have configured the Skill to show the detailed summary of the appointment details. However, you may also want to notify the user via Twilio SMS which is a short messaging service that sends user messages to their registered mobile number.
