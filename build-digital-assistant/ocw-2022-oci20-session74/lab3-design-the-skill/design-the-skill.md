# Design the Skill

## Introduction

Once you have the instance created, you can begin the development of your Oracle Digital Assistant instance. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of the Skill development process.

### Objectives

In this lab you will perform the following tasks: 

- Provision the Digital Assistant instance.
- Import a sample Skill within your instance.
- Create and test the intents and entities.

## Prerequisites

- Download the Skill template - <a href="https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/Ei1_2QRw4M8tQpk59Qhao2JCvEivSAX8MGB9R6PfHZlqNkpkAcnVg4V3-GyTs1_t/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/oci-library/CareClinics_Template.zip">download</a> 

## Task 1: Create a Digital Assistant Instance and Import the Skill
1. Once you are logged into Oracle Cloud, you are taken to the cloud services dashboard where you can see all the services available to you. Click the navigation menu in the upper left to show top-level navigation choices.
2. Click **Digital Assistant**

  ![Select ODA from the navigation menu.png](images/select-oda-from-navigation-menu.png " ")

3. Select the root compartment/compartment of your own and create a Digital Assistant instance. 

  ![Create an ODA instance](images/create-oda-instance.png " ")

4. After the instance is successfully created. Click on the Service Console to open the ODA console. 

  ![Select service console](images/select-service-console.png " ")

5. Now, select the navigation on the top left menu, select Skills under Development and import the Skill which you downloaded.

  ![Upload the template](images/upload-the-template.png " ")

6. Open the Skill to update the bot from the console.

  ![Open the Skill](images/open-skill.png " ")

7. Navigate the page to get familiar with the Terminology.

  ![Page Navigation](images/page-navigation.png " ")

8. Click on the Intent(leaf icon) within the Skill to get started with your next task. 

## Task 2: Create and Test an Intent
Oracle Digital Assistant's underlying natural language processing (NLP) engine doesn't inherently know about the business or task that skill is supposed to assist with. For the skill to understand what it should react to, you need to define intents and examples (utterances) for how a user would request a specific intent.

You will create intents for finding a doctor and positive health therapy tips. 

Create the Find a Doctor intent: 

1. Click the + Intent button.
2. Next to the Conversation Name field, click the Edit button and enter *Find Doctor*.
3. In the Name field, type *findDoctor*.
4. Select and copy all of the example sentences below to your clipboard and paste them   into the *Advance Input Mode* section under Examples

    ```
    <copy>
    find a doc
    help from doctor
    how can I find the doctor?
    looking for a doctor
    need doctor assistance
    Where is the doc?
    </copy>
    ```

    (You'll notice that it's fine for utterances to have inconsistent punctuation and capitalization.)
5. Click the +Create button.

  ![Create an intent](images/create-intent.png " ")

### Create the Positive Health intent:

1. Click the + Intent button.
2. Next to the Conversation Name field, click the Edit button and enter *Positive Health*.
3. In the Name field, type *positiveHealth*.
4. Select and copy all of the example sentences below to your clipboard and paste them into the *Advance Input Mode* section under Examples

    ```
    <copy>
    health tips
    mental health treatment
    need positive health tips
    positive outlook
    mental health therapy
    </copy>
    ```
5. Click the +Create button.

### Create the Unresolved intent:
The unresolved intent in a skill handles messages outside of the domain that the skill is designed to process. For this, you usually map a dialog flow state to the *unresolvedIntent* action transition to inform the user that the skill could not handle the request.

1. Click the + Intent button.
2. Next to the Conversation Name field, click the Edit button, and enter *Unresolved Intent*.
3. In the Name field, type *unresolvedIntent*.
4. Select and copy all of the example sentences below to your clipboard and paste them into the *Advance Input Mode* section under Examples

    ```
    <copy>
    blah blah
    buy me a tv
    play music
    sing a song
    </copy>
    ```
5. Click the +Create button.


### Train and test the intents:

You've now provided the basic ingredients that allow the skill to recognize user input for both intents. Currently, the skill can't understand any user input.

To enable the skill to interpret user input based on the utterances that you just added, you need to train to build the intent model.

1. On the right side of the page, locate and click the Train. Select *Trainer Ht* and then click *Submit*.

  ![Train the bot](images/train-the-bot.png " ")

2. Let's perform a quick test in the utterance tester.

- Click on Test utterance.

  ![Test utterances](images/test-utterance.png " ")

- Test your utterance (Ex: You can type "help me find a doctor").

  ![Test utterances dialog box](images/test-utterances-dialog.png " ")

## Task 3: Create Entities

Now it's time to add entities, which detect information in the user input that can help the intent to fulfill a user request. We will be creating entities with regular expressions, and value lists and adding them to a composite bag. 

1. In the left navigation for the designer, select the *Entities* icon.
 ![Click entities](images/click-entities.png " ")
2. Click + Add Entity to create a new entity.
3. In the Name field, change the value to *FirstName*.
4. Select the Configuration type as *Regular Expression* and value as [a-zA-Z]+
  ![Create entity](images/create-entity.png " ")
5. Click the Create button
6. Follow the same steps for entities:  
    - *LastName* (Name - LastName, type - Regular Expression, Value - [a-zA-Z]+)
    - *PhoneNumber* (Name - PhoneNumber, type - Regular Expression, Value - ^[\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]?[0-9]{4,6}$)
    - *State* (Name - State, type - Regular Expression, Value - [a-zA-Z]+)
    - *City* (Name - City, type - Regular Expression, Value - [a-zA-Z]+)

Create a Value List Entity

1. Click + Add Entity to create a new entity.
2. In the Name field, change the value to *TimePicker*.
3. In the Configuration section, select *Value list* from the Type menu.
4. Click + Value.
For Value, type *10:00 AM*.
For Synonyms, type *10am*, then click Enter. Type 10:00am, and then click Enter again.<br/> <br/>
Here is the list of values and synonyms:<br/>
  ![Create value list](images/create-value-list.png " ")
8:30 AM	- 8:30, 8:30am, 8:30 am <br/>
> **Note:** Hit the enter button after typing each synonym.

10:00 AM - 10am, 10:00am, 10:00 AM, 10 am <br/>
12:30 PM - 12:30pm, 12:30, 12:30 pm <br/>
2:00 PM	- 2:00 pm, 2 pm, 2pm, 2:00pm <br/>
3:30 PM	- 3:30pm, 3:30, 3:30 pm <br/>

Click Create.  
  ![Value list for Time picker](images/time-picker-value-list.png " ")
 
5. Repeat the above steps to create another value list for the *Provider*. <br/>

    Name: **Provider** <br/>
    Configuration: Value List <br/>
    Values: <br/>
    Dermatology	- Dermatology, derma <br/>
    Family Medicine	- FamilyMed, family medicine, family med <br/>
    Obstetrics and gynecology - ob gyn, ob-gyn, gyn, ob <br/>
    Pediatrics - pediatric, pediatrics <br/>
    Primary care - primarycare, primcare <br/>
    Other - something else, somethingelse, other, others, not here <br/>

  ![Value list for Provider](images/provider-value-list.png " ")

Create a Composite Bag Entity

In this step, you're going to simplify your development efforts using a composite bag entity, which enables you to manage the multiple entities that you just created as a consolidated entity. In addition to unifying your entities, the various composite bag properties enable your skill to match entity values in complex, real-world scenarios that involve erratic user input.

7. Click + Add Entity to create a new entity with the name *RegisterPatientBag* and select the Configuration type as *Composite Bag*.

  ![Create a Composite bag entity](images/create-composite-bag.png " ")

8. Select the *RegisterPatientBag* and add a *+ Bag Item*.
  ![Add bag item](images/add-bag-item.png " ")
9. Enter the Name as **FirstName**, select the type as *Entity* and Entity name as *FirstName* from the drop-down.
  ![Add first name to bag](images/add-first-name-to-bag.png " ")
10. Set the *Out of Order Extraction* as *Never* and add the following *prompts*:

    ```
    <copy>
    Enter the first name
    </copy>
    ```
    ```
    <copy>
    Invalid name, please re-enter your first name (Ex: John)    
    </copy>
    ```
