## PeopleSoft Cloud Manager overview ##

PeopleSoft Cloud Manager is a PeopleSoft application that runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to help accelerate adoption as well as to optimize the benefits of running PeopleSoft on Cloud. PeopleSoft Cloud Manager brings an unprecedented extent of automation to migrate your existing environment from on-premises and to rapidly clone and create new environments on the cloud tailored for specific functional use â€” such as development, customization, user acceptance testing, performance testing or production. PeopleSoft Cloud Manager comes with a built-in automated download manager and provides automated lifecycle operations such as PeopleTools only upgrade, PeopleTools update, setting up of selective adoption environments and automated self-update to the latest Cloud Manager Image.

**Notes:**

* The workshop is quite technical and in-depth. Please go slowly and without skipping any steps.

* For security purposes, some sensitive text (such as IP addresses) may be redacted in the screenshots in this workbook.
* The user interface for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is constantly evolving. As a result, the screens depicted in this tutorial may not exactly coincide with the current release. This tutorial is routinely updated for functional changes to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, at which time any differences in the user interface will be reconciled.
