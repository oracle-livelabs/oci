# Setting Up RackWare DR Components
## Introduction
This lab walks through the steps for configuring the RackWare Migration Manager (RMM), which replicates the source APEX instance.

Estimated Lab Time: 45-60 minutes

### Objectives
- Import the RMM
- Configure the RMM to replicate to the source instance
- Setup the DR policy

### Prerequisites
- Successful completion of previous labs in this workshop

## Task 1: Import RMM Image from Rackware

5.	Enter a Name for the instance.\
    a.	e.g. dr_rackware_rmm
6.	Give the instance a shape appropriate for your deployment.
7.   In the ‘Add SSH Keys’ either upload your ssh key to connect to the instance after it is created or paste the key contents

## Task 2: Configure the RackWare Migration Components
Use the following **[guide](https://www.rackwareinc.com/rackware-rmm-oracle-marketplace-dr-march-2020)** to complete the RackWare deployment configuration. (Use the passthrough method)

## Task 3: Create DR policy in RackWare
**After you have completed the RackWare guide you must make a DR policy in RackWare to keep the source & target machines synced.**
1. Start by navigating to the RackWare GUI and loging in with your RackWare admin credentials.
