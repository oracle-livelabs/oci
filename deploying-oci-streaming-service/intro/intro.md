## Oracle Streaming Service (OSS)

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable solution for ingesting and consuming high-volume data streams in real-time. Use Streaming for any use case in which data is produced and processed continually and sequentially in a publish-subscribe messaging model.

You can use Streaming for:

- **Messaging** - Use Streaming to decouple the components of large systems. Producers and consumers can use Streaming as an asynchronous message bus and act independently and at their own pace.

- **Metric and log ingestion** - Use Streaming as an alternative to traditional file-scraping approaches to help make critical operational data more quickly available for indexing, analysis, and visualization.

- **Web or mobile activity data ingestion** - Use Streaming for capturing activity from websites or mobile apps, such as page views, searches, or other user actions. You can use this information for real-time monitoring and analytics, and in data warehousing systems for offline processing and reporting.

- **Infrastructure and apps event processing** - Use Streaming as a unified entry point for cloud components to report their lifecycle events for audit, accounting, and related activities.

### Objectives

- How to create, update and delete stream pools and streams.

- Publishing of messages to the streams using OCI CLI.

- Consuming messages as an individual consumer.

- Consuming messages in a group.

## Oracle Cloud Shell

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud (OCI) Shell is a web browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console. Cloud Shell is free to use (within monthly tenancy limits), and provides access to a Linux shell, with a pre-authenticated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI, a pre-authenticated Ansible installation, and other useful tools for following Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service tutorials and labs. Cloud Shell is a feature available to all OCI users, accessible from the Console. Your Cloud Shell will appear in the Oracle Cloud Console as a persistent frame of the Console; and will stay active as you navigate to different pages of the Console.
